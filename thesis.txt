Supersymmetry is a promising extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. It
provides a mathematically elegant solution to some of the open questions of the Standard
Model. Supersymmetry can, for example, provide a candidate particle for dark matter.
In the first part of this work, ideas for an analysis in a final state with one lepton,
searching for the electroweak production of charginos with decays to W bosons and
the lightest supersymmetric particles, using the ATLAS detector, are presented. Due to
low cross-sections of chargino pair production and a high similarity to Standard Model
backgrounds, this specific decay got only recently into reach of the LHC experiments.
Using the presented ideas, statements about this model can be made for the first time in
final states with one lepton.
In the second part of this work, a simplification of a published analysis searching
for gluinos and squarks in events with exactly one lepton, multiple jets and missing
transverse momentum is presented. The simplification allows to interpret the analysis
in a large number of different models belonging to the phenomenological MSSM. Using
this approximation, a precise statement about the sensitivity of the analysis to a class
of more complete supersymmetric models (in comparison to simplified models) can be
made for the first time.

Supersymmetrie ist eine vielversprechende theoretische Erweiterung des Standardmodells
der Teilchenphysik und liefert mathematisch elegante Lösungen zu mehreren offenen
Fragen des Standardmodells. Viele supersymmetrische Modelle liefern, zum Beispiel,
einen Kandidaten für dunkle Materie.
Im ersten Teil dieser Arbeit werden Ideen für eine Suche nach elektroschwacher Produktion
von Charginos mit anschließendem Zerfall in W Bosonen und leichteste supersymmetri-
sche Teilchen, in Ereignissen mit einem Lepton mit dem ATLAS Detektor, vorgestellt.
Aufgrund der niedrigen Wirkungsquerschnitte für die Produktion von Charginos sowie
der starken Ähnlichkeit zu Standardmodell Untergründen, gelang dieses spezielle Modell
erst kürzlich in Reichweite der LHC Experimente. Mit den vorgestellten Ansätzen ist es
erstmals möglich, eine Aussage über dieses Modell in Endzuständen mit einem Lepton
zu treffen.
Im zweiten Teil dieser Arbeit wird eine Vereinfachung einer Suche nach Gluinos und
Squarks in Endzuständen mit exakt einem Lepton, Jets und fehlender transversaler
Energie vorgestellt. Die Vereinfachung erlaubt die Interpretation der Analyse in einer
großen Anzahl von Modellen des phänomenologischen MSSM. Mit dieser Approximation
ist es erstmals möglich, eine präzise Aussage über die Sensitivität der Analyse in voll-
ständigeren supersymmetrischen Modellen (verglichen mit vereinfachten Modellen) zu
machen.

Introduction

Particle physics studies the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter. The
theoretical framework used to describe nature at the subatomic scale is called the Standard
Model of Particle Physics. It has been developed throughout the second half of the 20th
century and is one of the most successful physical theories to date. The predictions
provided by the Standard Model have been found to match experimental results at an
unprecedented precision. Even at the high energies achievable with modern accelerator
technologies, no new physics beyond the Standard Model has been discovered so far.
It is, however, evident that the Standard Model cannot be a complete theory of nature. It
fails, for example, to correctly describe phenomena that become apparent on cosmological
scales. For example, the Standard Model only describes three of the four fundamental
forces of the universe, namely the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions. Gravity,
the last of the four fundamental forces, is not described by the Standard Model. Further-
more, although many astronomical observations indicate the existence of dark matter,
the Standard Model is unable to provide a suitable candidate particle for it. It seems that
the Standard Model, even though extremely precise and successful, is only a low-energy
approximation to a more fundamental theory of nature.
A plethora of theories aiming to explain these deficiencies exists. One very promising
class of theories is Supersymmetry. It extends the Standard Model by associating super-
symmetric partners to the Standard Model particles and could, for example, be able to
provide a candidate for dark matter. Although the first supersymmetric theories have
already been proposed in the 1970s [1], no supersymmetric particles have been found so
far. With a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV attained by the Large Hadron Collider in
2015, and maybe even 14 TeV in 2021 [2], there is still the possibility that supersymmetric
particles could be found in the data collected with the ATLAS detector in the coming
years.
In this work, various improvements to an analysis searching for supersymmetric particles
in events with exactly one lepton (electron or muon), multiple jets and missing transverse
momentum with the ATLAS detector are presented. After an introduction to the Standard
Model and Supersymmetry, a brief overview of the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS
experiment is given. Then, details on the simulations used and data collected are discussed,
followed by a description of the physics objects used within this work and a discussion of
the methods needed for statistical data analysis. In chapter 6, possibilities for a search to

electroweak production of supersymmetric particles by means of a specific supersymmetric
model are presented and discussed. Chapter 7 presents studies to broaden the scope of
the search to the phenomenological MSSM, a class of supersymmetric models with 19
parameters.
Chapter 1

Theory

The supersymmetric particles considered in this work mostly decay into the well-known
particles of the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). This chapter therefore aims to
give an overview on the SM, followed by an introduction to the concepts and motivations
of Supersymmetry which solves some of the short-comings of the SM.


1.1      The Standard Model of Particle Physics
Since the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J.J.Thomson [3], an observation that is often
considered to be the birth of particle physics itself, physicists have made extraordinary
progress in describing nature at the microscopic scale. Today, over 120 years and many
theoretical and experimental milestones later, the resulting theoretical framework, the
Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM), provides a precise and predictive description
of the interactions of elementary particles. It has been experimentally tested and verified
to a high degree of precision up to the electroweak (EWK) scale.
Due to its success in delivering extremely precise predictions of the interactions between
elementary particles, it is not surprising that the history of the SM is paved with numerous
awards, both for theoretical and experimental work. For example, in 1979, Glashow,
Weinberg and Salam (GWS) were awarded with the Nobel Prize for their work leading
to the electroweak unification. A few years later, in 1984, the Nobel prize was awarded
to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer for their work resulting in the observation of
the W ± and Z bosons, the mediators of the weak force that were theoretically predicted
by GWS through the electroweak unification. The most prominent recent progress is the
discovery of the Higgs (H ) boson in 2012, that not only led to the Nobel prize being
awarded to Higgs and Englert for their theoretical prediction, but also completed the SM
with its last particle being discovered roughly 50 years after its prediction. In its current
state, the SM successfully describes three of the four fundamental forces in the universe,
namely the electromagnetic, the weak, and the strong interaction. This leaves gravity as
the only fundamental force not described by the SM.

The following mathematical description of the SM follows, if not otherwise indicated,
Refs. [4, 5].


1.1.1     Quantum field theories
From a mathematical point of view, the SM is a collection of a special type of quantum
field theories, called gauge theories. Quantum field theory (QFT) is the unification of field
theory with relativistic quantum mechanics and gives a uniform description of quantum
mechanical particles and classical fields while including special relativity.
In classical mechanics, a particle can be described as a discrete point mass of which the
position in space is a function of time. By introducing a Lagrangian L (qi , q̇i ) depending
on the coordinates qi and velocities q̇i of the particle, the equation of motion of the
particle can be determined through the Euler-Lagrange equation

                                     d
                                                  !
                                          ∂L              ∂L
                                                      −       = 0.                     (1.1)
                                     dt   ∂ q̇i           ∂qi

In quantum field theory, however, particles are no longer considered to be localized mass
points but excitations in an underlying field occupying a certain region of space. These
continuous fields need to be described by one or more functions of space and time ϕi (⃗x, t).
Similar to classical mechanics though, quantum field theory also introduces a Lagrangian,
or rather a Lagrangian density L (ϕi , ∂µ ϕi ) that is a function of one or more fields and
its spacetime derivatives. The spacetime integral of the Lagrangian density is the action
                                          Z
                                  S=          L (ϕi , ∂µ ϕi ) d4 x.                    (1.2)

Using the principle of least action δS = 0, the equation of motion of each field in the
Lagrangian density is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation,
                                                      !
                                         ∂L        ∂L
                                ∂µ               −     = 0.                            (1.3)
                                      ∂ (∂µ ϕi )   ∂ϕi

Taking for example the free Dirac Lagrangian for a spin-1/2 field,

                                 L = ψ̄ (iγ µ ∂µ ) ψ − mψ̄ψ,                           (1.4)

and applying eq. (1.3) on the adjoint spinor ψ̄ yields

field theory.

1.1.2     Gauge symmetries
Symmetries are of central importance for the SM. As Emmy Noether has shown in
1918 [6], symmetries of the action of a physical system lead to conservation laws. In
classical mechanics the invariance of laws of physics under spatial translations gives rise
to momentum conservation and, similarly, the invariance under time translations results
in energy conservation.
Taking again the example of the Dirac Lagrangian in eq. (1.4), it is worth noting that
this Lagrangian is invariant under a global phase transformation

                                           ψ → eiθ ψ,                                        (1.6)

where θ is real and spacetime independent. According to Noether’s theorem, the existence
of global symmetries in the SM is related to the conservation of charge-like quantum
numbers. But even more important than the existence of global symmetries in the SM
is the procedure of enforcing these global symmetries to hold locally. In the SM, the
introduction of local symmetries, called gauge symmetries, directly dictates the existence
of massless gauge fields and their corresponding gauge particles.
Turning again to the free Dirac Lagrangian, it is clear that a local phase transformation
(where the phase θ is a function of spacetime)

                                          ψ → eiθ(x) ψ,                                      (1.7)

does not leave the Lagrangian invariant, since it picks up an additional term from the
derivative of θ, leading to

                                    L → L − (∂µ θ) ψ̄γ µ ψ.                                  (1.8)

However, by introducing a new gauge field Aµ (x) that transforms under local phase
transformations according to
                                              1
                                     Aµ → Aµ − ∂µ θ(x),                                      (1.9)
                                              e
and furthermore replacing the derivative ∂µ by the covariant derivative†

                                       Dµ ≡ ∂µ + ieAµ ,                                     (1.10)

the Lagrangian in eq. (1.4) becomes
                                                                 
                          L = ψ̄ (iγ µ ∂µ ) ψ − mψ̄ψ − eψ̄γ µ ψ Aµ .                        (1.11)
†
    The procedure of achieving local gauge invariance through the the substitution of ∂µ with Dµ is
    called minimal coupling rule.

As can be easily verified, this Lagrangian is indeed invariant under a local phase trans-
formation. Yet, the modified Lagrangian in eq. (1.11) cannot be complete as it is still
missing a free term for the field Aµ itself. For a vector field like Aµ , the Lagrangian
describing the free case is the Proca Lagrangian
                                         −1 µν        1 2 ν
                             LP roca =       F Fµν +   m A Aν ,                                 (1.12)
                                         16π         8π A
where F µν ≡ (∂ µ Aν − ∂ ν Aµ ) is the field strength tensor that is invariant under the
transformation in eq. (1.9). Since Aν Aν is not invariant under the same transformation,
the only way to keep the full Lagrangian invariant under a local phase transformation is
by requiring mA = 0, i.e. the introduced gauge field Aµ has to be massless. This yields
the full Lagrangian
                                                    1 µν              
                   L = ψ̄ (iγ µ ∂µ ) ψ − mψ̄ψ −        F Fµν − eψ̄γ µ ψ Aµ ,                    (1.13)
                                                   16π
which turns out to be the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The introduced
gauge field Aµ is thus nothing else but the electromagnetic potential with its associated
particle, the photon. Thus, by forcing a global phase invariance to hold locally, a new
massless gauge field has to be introduced in order for the Lagrangian to be invariant
under local phase transformations. The new gauge field not only comes with its own
kinetic term in the Lagrangian, but also introduces coupling to the fields already existing
in the Lagrangian. In the above case of the Dirac Lagrangian, the requirement of local
phase invariance produces all of quantum electrodynamics through the introduction of
the massless photon field, interacting with charged particles.
As the global phase transformation in eq. (1.6) is part of the unitary group U (1), the
Lie group of all 1 × 1 matrices with U † U = 1, this symmetry is called U (1)em gauge
symmetry † . But, as Yang and Mills have shown in 1954 [7], it is also perfectly possible to
require a global phase invariance to hold locally in the case of the special unitary group
SU (n), the Lie group of n × n matrices with determinant 1. As it finally turns out, the
SM is based upon a combination of three symmetry groups

                                  SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)Y ,                                  (1.14)

where SU (3)C generates quantum chromodynamics (QCD), i.e. the interaction of particles
with colour charge through the exchange of gluons, and SU (2)L × U (1)Y describes the
electroweak interaction. It is worth noting that the U (1)Y symmetry group present in
the SM is not exactly the U (1)em symmetry group from QED, since they have different
generators. Section 1.1.3 discusses this further.
In the electroweak interaction, the subscript L indicates that SU (2)L only couples to
left-handed particles, while Y refers to the weak hypercharge, given by the Gell-Mann-
†
    Here, the subscript ‘em’ stands for electromagnetic and is used to distinguish U (1)em from U (1)Y .

1.1.3     Particle content
In the SM, particles are classified into two main categories, depending on whether they
have integer or half-integer spin. Particles with half-integer spin follow Fermi-Dirac
statistics and are called fermions. Since they are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle,
they make up ordinary matter. Particles with integer spin follow the Bose-Einstein
statistics and are called bosons. They are needed in order to mediate the fundamental
interactions as fermions do not directly interact with each other. An overview of all
particles in the SM is given in tables 1.1 and 1.2.


Fermions

Fermions are further divided into leptons and quarks that each come in three generations
with increasing masses. Leptons form SU (2)L doublets consisting of an electrically charged
lepton and a corresponding neutral neutrino. While the SM assumes neutrinos to be
massless, the observation of neutrino oscillations [9] requires that at least two of them

are massive. By introducing neutrino masses† , the oscillations can be explained with a
lepton generation mixing, described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)
matrix [10]. As neutrinos only interact through the weak interaction, their experimental
detection is inherently difficult. Quarks carry both colour charge and electric charge
and form SU (2)L doublets of an up-type (u, c, t) and a down-type (d, s, b) quark.
The coupling between the three quark generations through the weak interaction can be
described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [11]. Since the SM is a
relativistic quantum theory, each fermion has an anti-particle that has the same mass and
spin, but inverted charge-like quantum numbers. In this work, the term ‘lepton’ refers
only to electrons and muons, but not taus.


Bosons

Bosons are the force carrier particles that mediate the forces between the fermions. As
described in section 1.1.2, each of the three symmetry groups in the SM is at the origin of
one or more massless gauge bosons that couple to the conserved charge of the respective
symmetry group they originate from.
The gauge theory associated with the SU (3)C symmetry group is quantum chromodynam-
ics (QCD), describing the strong interaction. The gauge bosons of the strong interaction
are the gluons (g), which couple only to particles with a colour charge. There are three
types of colour charge: red, green and blue (and their respective anti-colour). Gluons
themselves carry one unit of colour and one unit of anti-colour. Due to colour-confinement,
colour charged particles like gluons and quarks cannot exist as free particles, instead they
will always form colour-neutral bound states. Although, nine gluon states are possible,
only eight of them are realized in nature: the singlet state √13 (|rr̄⟩ + |gḡ⟩ + |bb̄⟩) would be
colour-neutral and allow long-range strong interactions, which have not been observed
[4].
The remaining two symmetry groups SU (2)L × U (1)Y of the electroweak theory are not
as straight-forward. Theoretically, SU (2)L manifests itself through the existence of three
massless spin-1 gauge bosons Wµ1 , Wµ2 , and Wµ3 , while U (1)Y causes the existence of

    Strictly speaking, introducing massive neutrinos is already an extension to the SM.

another massless spin-1 gauge boson Bµ . However, since the gauge bosons mediating
the weak force observed in nature are not massless, the electroweak symmetry has
to be broken. The mechanism allowing this spontaneous symmetry breaking of the
SU (2)L × U (1)Y gauge symmetry into U (1)em and introducing heavy gauge bosons is
called Higgs mechanism. It requires the introduction of a new complex scalar field,
the Higgs field, with a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) causing spontaneous
symmetry breaking while giving rise to four Goldstone bosons† . Three of the Goldstone
bosons are absorbed by the gauge bosons, that, in turn, gain a longitudinal polarization
mode and become massive. Two of the three Wµ bosons form a linear combination
producing the physical W ± bosons that couple to SU (2)L doublets,

where θW is the mixing angle, called Weinberg angle. While the photon couples to electric
charges Q, the Z boson has a coupling proportional to I3 − Q sin2 θW . The remaining
Goldstone boson manifests itself as an additional scalar boson, called the Higgs boson.
It couples to the W ± and Z 0 bosons as well as to all the massive fermions due to the
coupling terms being proportional to the fermion masses. With the discovery of the Higgs
boson in 2012, all particles predicted by the SM have been experimentally detected.


1.2      Supersymmetry
The following section presents an introduction to the concept of supersymmetry (SUSY).
It starts with a motivation of SUSY itself, followed by an introduction to the mathematical
description and phenomenological consequences of a supersymmetric theory. A complete
and detailed introduction to SUSY can be found in Ref. [14].


1.2.1     Limitations and open questions of the SM
Although the SM is a wildly successful theory able to describe and predict with extremely
high precision the interactions between elementary particles, there are still phenomena
in nature that cannot be suitably understood by the SM. Those limitations and open

questions of the SM are the reason for countless searches looking for new physics beyond
the SM (BSM). A class of BSM theories used in this work is supersymmetry.


Dark Matter

Multiple astrophysical observations hint to additional sources of gravity apart from the
ordinary visible matter described by the SM. One example of such an astrophysical
observation is the deviation in the rotation curves of galaxies. By observing stars in the
galaxies, the distribution of the orbital velocity with respect to their distance from the
galactic centre can be measured. When comparing the observed rotation curves with
those that would be expected based on the visible mass distribution in the galaxies, a
significant disagreement is seen. Objects on the verge of galaxies tend to rotate much
faster than expected, hinting at the presence of an additional source of gravity [15].
Another very compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter is the bullet cluster,
consisting of two colliding galaxy clusters. The visible mass of the colliding clusters is
mostly composed of hot gas interacting electromagnetically. During the collision, the
gases interact which each other and are significantly slowed down and distorted. The dark
matter, however, making up most of the clusters’ total masses and showing very little
interaction, survives the collision without much distortion. This can be experimentally
verified by observing background objects where the bullet cluster acts as gravitational
lens, showing that most of the clusters’ mass must have passed each other without
significant interaction [16].
While ordinary visible matter makes up only 4.9% of the energy density in the universe,
dark matter represents 26.8% of the energy density in our universe† [18]. It is therefore
particularly interesting to develop theories that provide candidates for dark matter. One
very popular possibility is the construction of dark matter through weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs). In many supersymmetric theories, the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) is stable and neutral and thus constitutes an ideal candidate for dark
matter.


The Hierarchy Problem

Due to its deficiencies, it is clear that the SM is not a complete theory of nature, but
rather a low-energy approximation to a more fundamental theory. As such, the SM is at
least valid up to the currently probed energies of O(TeV). At no later than the Planck
scale O(1015 TeV), the scale where quantum gravitational effects become important [14],
a new theoretical framework is necessary and new physics is expected to appear. However,
the mere fact that the two scales are roughly 15 orders of magnitude in energy apart
†
     The remaining 68.3% are occupied by Dark Energy, whose nature is yet another open question.
     More information is available in e.g. Ref. [17].

from each other is already a strong indication that new physics can be expected to exist
already far below the Planck scale.
The peculiarities introduced by the sheer difference between the two scales becomes much
more apparent when considering the Higgs mass. Since the Higgs boson is a scalar particle,
its mass is not protected from high quantum corrections through chiral symmetry. The
coupling of the Higgs field to a fermion f with mass mf as in fig. 1.1(a) yields a one-loop
correction to the Higgs squared mass given by

In eqs. (1.19) and (1.20), ΛU V refers to a cut-off scale at which the computation of the
loop corrections are cut off. This is necessary because the corrections are quadratic and
not logarithmic and therefore divergent. If ΛU V is taken to be the Planck scale, where new
physics is expected to appear, then the corrections to the Higgs boson squared mass can
become many orders of magnitude larger than the measured Higgs mass itself. Thus the
natural scale of the Higgs boson mass is the Planck scale, and not the electroweak scale.
In order to get to the observed value of roughly 125 GeV, the bare Higgs mass parameter
has to be tuned in such a way that it cancels precisely with the large corrections. This
extreme fine-tuning and sensitivity to physics at arbitrarily high scales is considered to
be unnatural.
In SUSY, the Higgs boson mass is automatically protected from the high contributions
to ∆m2H by introducing, for each fermion in the SM, two real scalars with λS = |λf |2 .
Since the fermion loop and boson loop corrections in eqs. (1.19) and (1.20) enter with

a relative minus sign, this introduced symmetry between fermions and bosons exactly
cancels the high corrections, making it possible for the observed Higgs mass to be at the
electroweak scale without the need of unnatural fine tuning.


Unification of forces

After the successful unification of the electromagnetic and the weak force to the elec-
troweak force, a valid question is if and how the SM could be extended to a grand
unified theory (GUT), a theory where the strong and the electroweak force are unified
in one single interaction. In a GUT, the symmetry groups of the SM are embedded
in a single symmetry group that is a superset of SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)Y with the
advantage that all the interactions would be described by one single symmetry group
with a single coupling constant. Accordingly, at the unification scale, the three running
coupling constants of the SM would combine into the single coupling constant of the
GUT. Although the inverse of the coupling constants of the SM run towards each other,
they do not exactly meet in a single point without new physics altering the running of
the coupling at some scale beyond the electroweak scale. This behaviour is illustrated in
fig. 1.2. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with new particles at
the TeV scale, exact unification is possible at roughly 1016 GeV, making SUSY an ideal
candidate for enabling the extension of the SM to a GUT.


1.2.2    Mathematical description
A supersymmetry transformation converts a fermionic state |f ⟩ into a bosonic state
|b⟩, and vice versa. The operator Q necessary to achieve such a transformation is an
1.2 Supersymmetry                                                                     13


anti-commuting spinor with

                                       Q |b⟩ = |f ⟩ ,                              (1.21)
                                       Q |f ⟩ = |b⟩ .                              (1.22)

Since Q is a spinor, its hermitian conjugate Q† is also a symmetry operator. As both Q
and Q† are fermionic operators, they carry a spin of 12 , meaning that supersymmetry must
be a spacetime symmetry, i.e. a Poincaré symmetry. In 1967, Coleman and Mandula have
shown with their ‘no go’ theorem [20], that the symmetry group of a consistent spacetime
quantum field theory must be the direct product of the internal symmetry group and
the Poincaré group. This would in principle rule out the possibility of supersymmetry
if it were not for the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius extension [21], stating that the only
non-trivial combination of an internal and spacetime symmetry is to use Lie superalgebra
(as opposed to Lie algebra) with fermionic generators [22]. Thus, it is not a coincidence
that the symmetry operator in SUSY is a spinor, it is the only possibility. In order
to obey the Coleman-Mandula theorem and simultaneously allow for parity-violating
interactions (as have been observed in the SM), the SUSY generators must satisfy the
following anti-commutation and commutation relations

                                {Q, Q† } = P µ ,                                   (1.23)

where P µ is the four-momentum generator of spacetime translations [14]. The irreducible
representations of the supersymmetry algebra are called supermultiplets and each contain
bosonic and fermionic states. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),
the smallest possible supersymmetric extension of the SM, the supermultiplets each
contain a SM particle as well as its superpartner. As can be seen in eq. (1.25), both SUSY
generators commute with spacetime translations P µ and hence also with the squared
mass operator −P 2 . Therefore, both single-particle states of a supermultiplet have the
same eigenvalues under −P 2 , meaning that mf = mb . Furthermore, the SUSY generators
also commute with the gauge transformation generators, thus supersymmetric particles
must have the same electric charge, weak isospin and colour charge as their SM partner,
living in the same supermultiplet.


1.2.3     Supersymmetry breaking
As set out in section 1.2.2, supersymmetric particles have the same masses as their SM
partners. If this were really the case, then the detection of supersymmetric particles
(sparticles) would have been straight-forward, as they would live in the same energy
range as the SM particles. Clearly, SUSY has to be a broken symmetry causing the
superpartners to have much higher masses than their SM counterparts. However, if broken

SUSY is still to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem through the cancellation of
the quadratic divergences in the Higgs boson squared mass, then the symmetry breaking
needs to be of a special form. In the MSSM, the supersymmetric theory considered in
this work, this is achieved through soft SUSY breaking such that the effective Lagrangian
of the MSSM can be written as

                                          L = LSUSY + Lsoft .                                                  (1.26)

Here, LSUSY is supersymmetry invariant and contains all the couplings while Lsoft breaks
supersymmetry [14]. This procedure allows for supersymmetric particles with masses
in the TeV scale. Therefore, SUSY could potentially be discovered at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider.


1.2.4     Particle content in the MSSM
The supermultiplets in the MSSM contain the same number of bosonic degrees of freedom
nb and fermionic degrees of freedom nf . In total, there are two main categories of
supermultiplets in the MSSM, chiral and gauge supermultiplets. The nomenclature of
the sparticles is as follows. On the one hand, the scalar partners of SM fermions are
constructed by prepending an ‘s’ to their name (e.g. selectron, stop, ...). On the other
hand, the spin-1/2 partners of the SM bosons are constructed by appending ‘-ino’ to
their name (e.g. Wino, Higgsino, ...). In general, the symbols for sparticles are the same
as for their SM counterparts, but with an additional tilde (e.g. ẽ, ũ, g̃, ...).
Chiral supermultiplets are the simplest supermultiplets for which nb = nf holds. They
consist of a Weyl fermion with two spin helicity states and two real scalar fields with one
degree of freedom each. The SM quarks and leptons are part of a chiral supermultiplet
and their spin-0 partners are scalar quarks (q̃) and scalar leptons (ℓ̃). The left- and right-

handed versions of the quarks and leptons are separate supermultiplets and therefore
have their own superpartners (e.g. ẽL and ẽR ). The subscripts L and R used to highlight
this separation are obviously only referencing to the helicity state of the SM particle and
not of the superpartner† . The particles in the chiral supermultiplets are summarized in
table 1.3.
The next-simplest supermultiplets for which nb = nf holds are the gauge supermultiplets.
They contain a massless§ spin-1 gauge boson with two helicity states and a massless
spin-1/2 Weyl fermion with two helicity states. The SM gauge bosons (W ± , W and B)
are part of a gauge supermultiplet and their spin-1/2 superpartners are the gauginos.
Table 1.4 summarizes the particles in the gauge supermultiplets.
The Higgs boson, being a scalar particle, must live in a chiral supermultiplet. However,
in order to avoid gauge anomalies, the MSSM actually needs two Higgs supermultiplets,
one with Y = 1/2 and one with Y = −1/2. The two SU (2)L doublets with Y = ±1/2
are called Hu and Hd , respectively. In total, the Higgs doublets lead to eight degrees of
freedom, three of which are absorbed in order to generate the gauge boson masses in
the electroweak symmetry breaking. The remaining five degrees of freedom lead to five
different Higgs bosons, two CP even states h0 and H 0 , one CP odd state A0 and two
charged bosons H ± . The state h0 is considered to be the SM Higgs boson.
Additionally, the MSSM predicts particles that have no direct equivalent in the SM.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, the electroweak gauginos and higgsinos mix to
form mass eigenstates that are identified with new particles. The two charged winos and
the two charged higgsinos form two charged mass eigenstates called charginos (χ̃±          1 , χ̃2 ),
                                                                                                 ±

while the neutral wino and bino mix with the remaining neutral higgsinos to form four
neutral mass eigenstates called neutralinos (χ̃01 , χ̃02 , χ̃03 and χ̃04 , ordered with increasing
masses).


1.2.5      R-parity
If the superpotential is to be renormalisable and follow the gauge-invariance of the SM,
then its most general form allows for terms that violate the baryon number B or the
lepton number L. Processes that violate the baryon or the lepton number have not yet

been observed in the SM, causing the violating terms in the superpotential to be heavily
constrained. One very prominent constraint is the non-observation of proton decays by
the Super-Kamiokande Experiment, determining the lower limit for the decay time of the
proton into lepton+meson final states to be above 1032 years [23]. In order to ensure that
the B- and L-violating terms in the general form of the superpotential do not appear in
the MSSM, a new conserved quantity, called R-parity, is introduced

                                   PR = (−1)3(B−L)+2s .                               (1.27)

Here, s is the spin of the particle the R-parity is to be computed of. As can be easily
verified, PR = +1 for SM particles and PR = −1 for SUSY particles. Apart from
suppressing the L- and B-violating terms in the MSSM Lagrangian, this multiplicative
quantity introduces some interesting phenomenological consequences. SUSY particles
can only be produced in pairs and each vertex in the MSSM must have an even number
of SUSY particles. Furthermore, the LSP, being the lightest supersymmetric particle,
has to be stable. Considering that the LSP only interacts weakly, this makes it an ideal
candidate for dark matter.


1.2.6     Simplified models
In searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider, it is common to use simplified
models [24, 25] as a way to reduce the parameter space to a manageable level. This
circumvents the issue of having to search for SUSY in a vast parameter space where a
lot of parameters may have only small effects on observables. In the simplified models
appearing in this work, all branching fractions are considered to be at 100% and all
supersymmetric particles not explicitly participating in the decay chain are set to be
kinematically inaccessible. The masses of the produced SUSY particles in each model are
free parameters that need to be scanned. It is therefore common to sort the scanned signal
models in signal grids where the mass parameters each occupy an axis. As each scanned
signal model occupies a single grid point corresponding to its specific combination of
SUSY particle masses in the grid, the term signal point is in the following often used to
refer to a single signal model with a given set of mass parameters.
The simplified model primarily used within this work is depicted in fig. 1.3(a). In the
following, it is referred to as the WW model. It considers the electroweak pair production
of two lightest charginos χ̃± 1 that each decay into a W boson and a lightest neutralino
χ̃1 . One of the two W bosons is required to further decay leptonically, the other one
  0

hadronically. As described in section 1.2.5, due to R-parity conservation, the produced
lightest neutralinos are stable and therefore escape the detector without interaction,
producing missing transverse energy, a quantity described in detail in section 4.3.6. As
this rather generic simplified model easily produces a final state that is of interest for an
analysis requiring an isolated lepton (called 1-lepton analysis and further described in
chapter 4), one main topic discussed in this work is the evaluation of the sensitivity of
this analysis to the WW model.

                    Figure 1.3: Simplified models considered in this work.


A second model of special interest for this work is the model pictured in fig. 1.3(b). It
has already been investigated by the 1-lepton analysis [26] and, in this work, is used to
validate a procedure developed for the analysis in order to broaden the scope of the search
for the phenomenological MSSM, a class of supersymmetric models with 19 parameters
(further explained in section 1.2.7). Details and results of these studies are discussed in
chapter 7. The model considers the strong pair production of two gluons that each decay
via an intermediate χ̃±    1 to the χ̃1 . In each of the two decay branches, two quarks and a W
                                      0

boson appear. If one of the W bosons decays leptonically, then this simplified model can
again produce a final state with an isolated lepton, multiple jets and missing transverse
energy. The model is defined by three parameters: the gluino mass, the LSP mass and
the ratio of mass differences between the chargino and the LSP and the gluino and the
           m(χ̃±        0
               1 )−m(χ̃1 )
LSP, x = m(g̃)−m(   χ̃01 )
                           . In order to allow for varying values for all three parameters, two
separate signal grids are defined, one with x = 12 and one with varying x but m(χ̃01 ) fixed
to 60 GeV. Due to its decay chain with production of an intermediate χ̃±        1 , the model will
in the following be referred to as gluino one-step model.


1.2.7      The phenomenological MSSM
Since searches for SUSY have not yet found supersymmetric particles, their results are
used to constrain the model space in which supersymmetry can be realised. In SUSY,
this is usually done by setting lower limits to the masses of the sparticles involved in the
respective search. Within the ATLAS Collaboration, there are a multitude of different
SUSY searches, each setting lower limits. Naturally, it is of particular interest to be
able to state a combined performance and sensitivity to SUSY. This would also allow
to identify regions in the parameter space without any (or only poor) sensitivity to
supersymmetric models, yielding additional input to the design of analyses.
18                                                                                      Theory


Although the use of simplified models is often a very useful method to capture a wide
range of different phenomena, this method fails to capture more complex effects resulting
from a larger set of parameters and the influence of other production and decay processes.
In order to derive a combined sensitivity to SUSY as well as combined constraints to
the model space in SUSY, it is therefore necessary to do a systematic scan of a set of
parameters properly describing the entire model space. Although the MSSM is a minimal
supersymmetric theory, it still has a total of 105 free parameters, which is too much
to be scanned exhaustively and compared to data. By applying a series of constraints
designed to discard models that are not phenomenologically viable but select those that
are more realistic, the set of free parameters can be reduced to 19. This is called the
phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM).
The reduction of parameters is obtained by applying the following constraints on the
MSSM [27]:

     • The parameters arising from soft SUSY breaking must be real, such that no new
       source of CP violation appears.

     • No new source of additional flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC).

     • The first and second generation sfermions must have degenerate masses.

These three constraints, together with the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions,
reduce the number of parameters to the following 19:

     • tan β: the ratio of the VEVs of the two Higgs fields.

     • MA : the mass of the CP odd Higgs boson.

     • µ: the Higgs-higgsino mass parameter.

     • M1 , M2 , M3 : the bino, wino and gluino mass parameters.

     • mq̃ , mũR , md˜R , mℓ̃ , mẽR : the masses of the first and second generation sfermions.

     • mQ̃ , mt̃R , mb̃R , mL̃ , mτ̃R : the masses of the third generation sfermions.

     • At , Ab , Aτ : the trilinear couplings of the third generation sfermions.

The above list of parameters and more information on the pMSSM itself can be found in
Ref. [27]. With the reduced number of parameters, it is possible to perform exhaustive
scans of the pMSSM parameter space and compare the results with data from ATLAS.
The results from a Run-1 pMSSM scan with ATLAS data are available in Ref. [28].

Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, it was founded in 1954 and, by now, counts 22 member
states [29]. CERN’s main research area is particle physics, which is why the organization
operates a multitude of different particle accelerators and detectors.


2.1      The Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [30] is the largest particle accelerator situated at
CERN. The tunnel housing the LHC was previously built for the Large Electron Positron
Collider (LEP) and lies between 175 m (under the Jura) and 50 m (close to Lake Geneva)
below the surface, resulting in a tilt of about 1.4%. With a circumference of 26.7 km [30],
the LHC is the largest accelerator on Earth. Due to the geometry of the tunnel, the
accelerator is composed of eight arcs and eight straight sections. The arcs are filled with
a total of 1232 [30] dipole magnets responsible for keeping the particle beam on their
trajectory around the √ ring. These dipole magnets are the limiting factor√of the maximal
centre-of-mass energy s of the LHC. In order to reach the design energy s = 14 TeV, i.e.
7 TeV per beam, the magnets have to create a magnetic field with a strength of 8.3 T [31].
Such high magnetic fields can only be reached by using superconductive magnets that
need to be operated at a temperature of 1.9 K [31]. Together with the quadrupole magnets
used for beam-shaping, as well as other magnets used for beam-injection and -dumping,
the LHC contains a total of 9593 magnets [30]. The eight straight sections each serve as
insertion region (IR) either for particle detectors or for machine hardware of the collider
itself. The IRs are labelled clockwise, with IR 1 being the closest one to the CERN
Meyrin site. IR 4 contains a total of 16 radio-frequency (RF) cavities, responsible for
accelerating the particles. Due to the RF cavities, the accelerated particles are grouped in
packages called bunches, with a length of ca. 7.5 m (or 25 ns) each. Each beam contains
a total of 2808 bunches as design value [30]. The counter-rotating beams are brought

to collision at four of the eight IRs, called interaction points (IPs). IP 1 houses the
ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector, while IP 5, located on the opposite site
of the ring, is where the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is situated. The two
remaining IPs 2 and 8 next to ATLAS host the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb)
experiment and A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE). While ATLAS and CMS are
general-purpose detectors, LHCb is specialized on b-physics and ALICE on heavy ion
physics. Apart from the four main experiments, there are three more making use of the
proton or ion beams of the LHC: the Large Hadron Collider forward (LHCf) experiment,
the Total Elastic and diffractive cross section measurement (TOTEM) and the Monopole
and Exotics Detector at the LHC (MoEDAL).
Before being injected into the LHC, the particles are pre-accelerated by CERN’s accelera-
tor complex, pictured in fig. 2.1. The particles start at the linear accelerator 2 (LINAC2),
pass through the Booster, then are further accelerated in the Proton Synchrotron (PS),
followed by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) before finally reaching the LHC with an
energy of 450 GeV. The LHC is responsible for the last acceleration step to the nominal
beam energy. In its first proton-proton run (Run-1), the LHC reached a beam energy
of 3.5 TeV (2010-2011) and 4 TeV (2012) [32]. After a two year long shut down phase
used for maintenance and upgrades,  √ the second run of proton-proton collisions (Run-2)
started at 6.5 TeV beam energy√( s = 13 TeV) in 2015 [33], which is just short of the
design centre-of-mass energy of s = 14 TeV [30].
2.2 The ATLAS Experiment                                                                   21


2.2      The ATLAS Experiment
The ATLAS detector is one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC. Located at
IP 1, it is 44 m long and 25 m high and sits in a cavern roughly 100 m below the surface.
A detailed description off the ATLAS detector can be found in Ref. [35].


2.2.1     Coordinate System
In order to properly describe events in the ATLAS detector, a suitable coordinate system
is needed. The right-handed coordinate system [36] has the nominal interaction point as
its origin. The beam line is used to define the z-axis, the positive x-axis points towards
the centre of the LHC ring and the positive y-axis is defined to point straight upwards.
In the x-y-plane, called the transverse plane, the azimuthal angle ϕ is the angle around
the beam axis while the polar angle θ is measured from the beam axis. The rapidity y
[37] is defined to be

                                       1   E + pz
                                                        !
                                    y = ln        .                                     (2.1)
                                       2   E − pz

Since differences in the rapidity are invariant under Lorentz boosts in the z-direction, y
is preferred over the polar angle θ.
The pseudorapidity [37] is the high-energy limit of the rapidity, only valid for p ≫ m
and θ ≫ γ1 and defined as

                                                   θ
                                       η = − ln tan .                                   (2.2)
                                                   2
Compared to the rapidity, the pseudorapidity has the advantage of not depending on the
energy and momentum calibration of the detected objects. Additionally, it gives a direct
correspondence to the polar angle θ.
The distance between two objects is given by
                                         q
                                  ∆R =       (∆η)2 + (∆ϕ)2 .                            (2.3)

The longitudinal momentum of the partons composing the colliding hadrons is only
known by means of parton distribution functions (PDFs), stating the probabilities of
the partons to have a certain energy in the direction of the beam. Therefore, the total
longitudinal energy in each collision is not exactly known, making it difficult to use physics
quantities in the z-direction. In the x–y plane, however, momentum conservation can be
easily applied, which is why mainly transverse physics quantities are used, indicated by a
subscript ‘T’, e.g. ET or pT .

Figure 2.2: Computer generated picture of the ATLAS detector, giving an overview on the
various subsystems [38].


2.2.2     Subdetectors
The ATLAS detector has a toroidal symmetry and is built of multiple subdetector
systems [35]. Most of the subdetectors are built following the toroidal symmetry of
ATLAS. In general, they have a central barrel part, designed to detect particles with
relatively small |η|, complemented by two disk-shaped end caps that detect particles
travelling close to the beam pipe with high |η|. A computer generated picture of the
detector is shown in fig. 2.2.


Inner detector
The inner detector (ID) is the subdetector closest to the beam pipe. It consists of three
different detector systems and is embedded in a 2 T solenoid magnetic field [35]. The
magnetic field causes the tracks of charged particles to be bent in the transverse plane
through the Lorentz force. This can be used to determine the momentum and charge
sign of the detected particle.
The innermost layer of the ID is composed of silicon pixel detectors. Originally the
pixel detector consisted of three layers specifically built to withstand the high-radiation
environment close to the beam pipe, while being able to deliver the high spatial resolution
necessary for a reliable vertex identification. In order to increase redundancy and reliability
in even higher radiation environments caused by higher luminosity, a new innermost pixel
2.2 The ATLAS Experiment                                                                              23


layer, called Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [39] was inserted before the start of Run-2 [40].
The pixel detector provides a spatial resolution in r − ϕ (z) direction of 10 (115) µm [35].
The second subsystem of the ID, the silicon strip trackers (SCT) provide an additional
source of particle tracking with a spatial resolution of 17 (580) in r − ϕ (z) direction [35].
Similar to the pixel detector, the SCT provides tracking information up to |η| < 2.5 [35].
The third and largest of the ID subsystems is the transition radiation tracker (TRT),
using drift tubes to provide particle tracking information. The drift tubes have a diameter
of 4 mm [35] and are orientated parallel to the beam pipe. Filled with a gas mixture, the
tubes can detect transition radiation photons emitted by traversing particles. This is
also used to provide additional electron identification. The TRT covers a range up to
|η| < 2.0 [35].


Calorimeters
Energy measurements in ATLAS are done with calorimeters. Since they are designed
to fully absorb the particles, the calorimeters are located around the tracking system
of the inner detector. In the ATLAS detector, there are two types of calorimeters, an
electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCal). Both calorimeters
are sampling calorimeters, consisting of alternating layers of active and absorbing material.
The absorbing material interacts with the traversing particles and causes them to deposit
their energy by creating showers of particles. The active layers are then used to record
the shape and intensity of the produced showers.
The ECal uses liquid argon (LAr) as active material and accordion-shaped lead plates as
absorber. Located next to the inner detector, the ECal is responsible for measuring the
energies of electromagnetically interacting particles. It has a thickness of > 22 radiation
lengths† in the barrel and > 24 radiation lengths in the end-cap [35].
The HCal in the barrel uses scintillating tiles (Tile calorimeter) as active material and
lead absorber plates. In the end-cap region, the HCal uses LAr as active material and
copper as absorber.
Together with the LAr forward calorimeters, the calorimeter system in ATLAS provides
energy measurements up to |η| < 4.9 [35].


Muon spectrometers
Muons are minimally ionizing particles and pass through the calorimeter system without
losing much energy. Immersed in a toroidal magnetic field, the muon spectrometers
(MS) form the outermost layer of the ATLAS detector and allow a measurement of
the muon momentum that is independent from the measurement of the inner detector.
†
    The radiation length is a characteristic of a material and describes the length after which the energy
    of a traversing particle has decreased to 1/e of its initial energy due to radiation losses.
24                                                                 The LHC and ATLAS


The muon spectrometers consist of four different detector types. Most of the precision
tracking information is obtained with Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers with an
average precision of 35 µm per chamber [35]. In the innermost layer of the forward region
2.0 < η < 2.7, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC), multi-wire proportional chambers, are
used. The muon trigger system relies on Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the barrel
region and Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) in the end-caps.


2.2.3     Trigger system
With a bunch spacing of 25 ns and up to 1011 protons in a single bunch, the event rates
in ATLAS can get as high as 40 million events per second [35]. With a mean event size
of approximately 1.3 MB [35], this equals a data volume of up to 50 TB per second,
orders of magnitude more than any database in the world could write to tape, and much
higher than any detector technology would be able to properly read out. In order to
keep the amount of data written to tape at a manageable level and select only events
containing potentially interesting physics, ATLAS employs a trigger system composed
of a hardware-based first level trigger (L1) and a software-based High-Level-Trigger
(HLT) [41]. The L1 trigger reduces the event rate from to about 100 kHz, based on muon
spectrometer and calorimeter information. In order to achieve this event rate reduction,
the L1 trigger has to make a decision within 2.5 µs. The HLT uses full granularity detector
information in order to run reconstruction algorithms. With a processing time of 200 ms
per event, the HLT reduces the event rate from 100 kHz to approximately 1 kHz. At this
reduced rate, events can be written to permanent storage.

Data and Monte Carlo Simulation

3.1      Data
The number of events recorded by the ATLAS detector is usually expressed by the
integrated luminosity L through
                                                   Z
                                    N = σL = σ         L dt,                            (3.1)

where N is the number of events, σ is the total cross section of the studied processes and
L is the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC at IP 1 [31]. The instantaneous luminosity
is given by

                                          Nb2 nb frev γr
                                     L=                  F,                             (3.2)
                                           4πϵn β ∗
where Nb is the number of particles per bunch, nb the number of bunches in each beam,
frev the collision frequency, γr the relativistic Lorentz factor, ϵn the normalized transverse
beam emittance and β ∗ the beta function at the collision point. The factor F is a
geometric factor indicating the luminosity reduction due to the crossing angle at the
interaction point. The design peak instantaneous luminosity at IP 1 (ATLAS) and IP 5
(CMS) for proton-proton collisions is L = 1034 cm−2 s−1 [31]. Figure 3.1 summarises the
peak instantaneous luminosities per fill of the LHC during data taking in 2015 and 2016.
Part of the studies presented in this work uses
                                             √ data from proton-proton collisions recorded
by ATLAS throughout 2015 and 2016 at s = 13 TeV. In total, the data that is used
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of L = 36.1 fb−1 .

3.2       Monte Carlo simulation
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations play a crucial role in high energy physics analyses. MC
simulations are computational algorithms that use repeated random sampling to solve
problems, often the estimation of multi-dimensional integrals for which an analytic answer
is not known [42]. As, in principle, this approach can be used for any problem that has
a probabilistic interpretation, it is especially suitable for particle physics where many
aspects are inherently connected to probability distributions. Here, MC simulations are
used to estimate the expected events of SM processes and predict the events of physics
beyond the SM in a given phase space.
The generation of a simulated proton-proton collision at the LHC with a general-purpose
MC generator can be divided in the following steps [43]:

     i. Hard scattering

     ii. Parton shower

  iii. Hadronisation

  iv. Underlying event

     v. Unstable particle decays

The hard scattering simulates the process with the highest momentum transfer in an
event. Since incoming partons can be described with parton distribution functions (PDFs),
the probabilistic distribution of the outgoing partons can be computed with perturbative
QCD. Parton showering is the result of initial and final state radiation (ISR,FSR). Similar
to bremsstrahlung in QED, scattered partons carrying colour charge radiate gluons. Since
3.2 Monte Carlo simulation                                                                 27


gluons themselves carry colour charge, an emitted gluon can cause new radiation, resulting
in a showering process with mostly soft gluons filling up the phase space. This process
is simulated as a sequential step-by-step process, from high momentum (hard gluons)
to low momentum scale (soft gluons), down to a point where perturbative QCD starts
to break down and partons hadronise. The hadronisation step forming colour neutral
hadrons uses non-perturbative models like the cluster model [37] used in the Herwig
generator [44] or the Lund model [37] used in the Pythia generator [45]. As there is a
high probability that there will be other interactions in the recorded event contaminating
the hard process, the simulation adds additional soft underlying events, also called in-time
pile-up. In the final step of the simulation, unstable hadrons are decayed into particles
that can be observed in the detector.
In order to allow for a direct comparison with data, the predicted number of MC events
Npred needs to be normalised to the total cross section σtot of the processes in consideration
and scaled to the integrated luminosity of the data that is used. In general, MC events
have weights that also need to be accounted for in the correct normalisation. Weights
are for example used when including next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections in the MC
generation or when using event filters during the generation, filtering only interesting
events and thereby increasing the computational efficiency. Thus, instead of using the
raw number of generated MC events, the sum of event weights w, scaled to the desired
integrated luminosity and total cross section has to be used [46],

                                       σtot L dt
                                             R
                                     =                                                  (3.3)
                                                     X
                             Npred        P      ·           wi .
                                               wi i∈selected
                                       i∈generated

The statistical uncertainty on the MC simulation caused by the finite size of the simulated
sample is then given by the square root of the sum of squared weights,
                                                 s
                                  ∆Npred =                                              (3.4)
                                                     X
                                                              wi2 .
                                                 i∈selected


As a physical detector is not a perfect or ideal machine, the generated MC events usually
undergo a detector simulation aiming to reproduce effects caused by the detector response.
This is done either with Geant4 [47] or an ATLAS fast simulation [48].


3.2.1     Used Monte Carlo samples
An overview of the MC generators used for the simulation of the SM background and
SUSY signal processes considered in this work is given in table 3.1. The different SM
processes considered as background in this work are further explained in section 4.2.
Backgrounds like W + jets, Z + jets and diboson production are simulated with the
Sherpa generator [49]. The generation of tt̄ and single top processes is done with
Powheg-Box v2 [50] while the parton showering is performed by Pythia 8 [45, 51].

The SM background process tt̄ + V † is generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [52],
while the parton showering is done again with Pythia 8. QCD multi-jet processes are
simulated with Pythia 8. All simulated SM processes are subject to a full ATLAS
detector simulation (Fullsim) [48] using Geant 4.
The simulation of SUSY Signal is done with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Pythia
8. Contrary to the SM background processes, the used SUSY simulations do not undergo
a full detector simulation, but the fast ATLAS simulation (AtlFast-II), allowing a 10
to 100 times faster processing than Fullsim [48]. The faster processing time is achieved
by replacing the simulation of particles interacting with the detector material in the
calorimeters with pre-computed parametrizations of the energy deposits per particle§ .

     The V in tt̄ + V stands for vector boson.

     The parametrizations are based on a fully-simulated (i.e. with Geant4) sample with 30 million
     events containing single photons and charged pions with energies between 200 MeV − 500 GeV,
     evenly distributed in η and ϕ [48].

The 1-lepton final state

The studies presented in this work are part of ongoing research and development efforts
done within an ATLAS analysis group searching for supersymmetric particles in final
states with exactly one lepton. This chapter starts with a brief introduction of the
existing analyses that provide the basis for this work, followed by a presentation of the
backgrounds that need to be considered when studying the 1-lepton channel. Finally, the
definitions of the used physics objects are discussed.


4.1      Analyses overview
This work is based on two separate analyses searching for SUSY in final states with
exactly one lepton. The first analysis, hereafter called strong 1-lepton analysis [26] (as
opposed to electroweak), considers models where squarks and gluinos are pair-produced
through strong interaction and subsequently, via varying decay chains, decay into final
states with exactly one isolated lepton, multiple jets and missing transverse momentum.
One of the models considered by the strong 1-lepton analysis is the gluino one-step model
depicted in fig. 1.3(b). This model will be of further interest in chapter 7. The strong
1-lepton analysis is a powerful search sensitive to a large variety of signal models and
providing highly competitive exclusion limits on gluino and squark masses [26]. More
information on the signal regions and statistical methods employed in the analysis are
given in section 7.1.2.
The second analysis providing a basis for this work, is a search for supersymmetric
particles that have been produced through electroweak interaction [53]. The simplified
model studied by this search is depicted in fig. 4.1(a). It considers the electroweak
production of the lightest chargino χ̃± 1 and the next-to-lightest neutralino χ̃2 . The χ̃1

further decays into an LSP and a W boson, that, in turn, decays into a lepton and a
neutrino, thereby producing a final state with a single lepton. The χ̃02 decays into an
LSP and a Higgs boson that further decays into two b-quarks. In the detector, the two
b-quarks will appear as two b-jets originating from a displaced secondary vertex and have

an invariant mass close to the Higgs mass. As other decays of the Higgs boson are not
considered, the branching ratio BR(H → bb̄) = 0.58 for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV
is factored in. In the following, this search will be referred to as the electroweak 1-lepton
analysis and the model in question will be referred to as the Wh model. The presence of the
two b-jets originating from a Higgs boson provides a powerful discrimination against SM
processes, such that sensitivity to this model can already be expected with partial Run-2
data [53]. On the other hand, however, this introduces an inevitable model-dependency
since the appearance of a Higgs boson decaying into two b-quarks is required in the
supersymmetric decay chain.
Previous experience in the strong 1-lepton analysis has shown that the 1-lepton final state
is a powerful channel for searching for SUSY particles produced by strong interaction
while remaining model-independent to a large degree† . Due to the growing amount of
data collected by the ATLAS detector, searches for electroweak production of SUSY
particles, that have in the past often been out of reach due to lower cross-sections, are
becoming increasingly interesting. Therefore, one possible improvement of the 1-lepton
analyses is the extension to electroweak SUSY models that do not require distinctive
decays like H → bb̄ and thus are more generic and result in a more model-independent
search. Chapter 6 presents and discusses the results of studies assessing whether or not
the 1-lepton channel is sensitive to such a generic model, namely the W W model shown
in fig. 4.1(b).
†
     The observed data is of course interpreted in simplified models, however the studied models are
     chosen to be as generic as possible.

4.2      Standard Model backgrounds
Although the requirement of exactly one lepton reduces the majority of the QCD
background, numerous SM processes can yield final states with exactly one isolated
lepton, multiple jets and missing transverse momentum. In general, background sources
can be classified into reducible and irreducible backgrounds. Irreducible backgrounds are
processes that have a phase space that is indistinguishable from the signal final state.
Reducible backgrounds stem from partially misreconstructed processes. An example of
a source of reducible backgrounds are events where a lepton originates from a heavy
flavour (HF) decay, photon conversions, or misreconstructed jets. In the SM, processes
that yield an isolated lepton, jets and missing transverse momentum typically involve
a leptonic decay of a W boson. The neutrino from the W boson decay will result in
missing transverse momentum. QCD radiation or other branches of the process can cause
additional jets to appear in the final state.
The largest SM background contribution stems from the production of a W boson with
additional jets (W + jets) and tt̄ production. Another important source of background in
many interesting kinematic regions is diboson production. The production of single top
quarks and top quark pairs with an associated vector boson (tt̄ + V ) are also considered,
as is the production of Z + jets. Figure 4.2 shows exemplary Feynman diagrams of these
SM background processes, illustrating how a final state with one isolated lepton, multiple
jets and missing transverse momentum can occur.

Figure 4.3: QCD background can be successfully suppressed by a cut on the missing transverse
momentum. In the top part of the plot, the missing transverse energy distribution of SM processes
is shown. The lower pad shows the relative contributions of the different backgrounds when
integrating to the right. A preselection of exactly one isolated lepton and at least two jets is
applied. With cut values above 150 GeV, the QCD multi-jet background can be reduced to a
negligible amount.


For Z+jets, the only irreducible process comes from Z → τ τ where one τ -lepton undergoes
a leptonic and the other one a hadronic decay. Since τ -leptons are not identified within the
1-lepton analysis, the hadronic τ is reconstructed as a jet. Other processes contributing to
Z + jets are reducible backgrounds, where some sort of misidentification takes place, e.g.
one lepton from Z → ℓ+ ℓ− could be lost during the reconstruction. Reducible processes
contributing to the other backgrounds are also considered.
Pure QCD multi-jet background can only appear in the 1-lepton final state through
the false reconstruction of a lepton (fake leptons). In this work, no MC simulation of
QCD background is considered for the majority of the studies. One reason for this is
the fact that a reliable MC simulation of QCD is inherently difficult and thus, signal
regions with tight requirements on observables often result in very few raw MC events
with unrealistically high event weights. Another reason justifying neglecting a QCD MC
simulation is the suppression power of a missing transverse energy (ETmiss ) requirement.
As can be seen in fig. 4.3 a moderate requirement of ETmiss > 150 GeV already suppresses
the majority of a QCD multi-jet MC simulation, to a point where the contribution
from it is well below the levels of minor backgrounds like Z + jets or single top. As all
preselections applied within this work apply a requirement of at least ETmiss > 150 GeV,
QCD contribution is considered to be negligible and thus a QCD estimation is not
incorporated in the following† .
†
     In a full analysis, QCD would need to be estimated with data-driven methods or more detailed
     studies would need to show that it is indeed negligible in every considered kinematic region.

4.3      Object definitions and event selection
The reconstruction of physics objects requires the combination of information from
multiple sub-detectors. Due to the sheer amount of data generated in the collisions,
this procedure does not always work without flaws. Sometimes, objects are falsely
reconstructed, or not reconstructed at all. In order to minimise reconstruction errors,
quality and reconstruction criteria are introduced for each physics object category.
Electrons and muons are classified into baseline and signal objects. Baseline objects have
a smaller purity but a higher acceptance which is useful for the computation of e.g. the
missing transverse momentum in an event. Signal objects have stricter requirements on
the isolation and identification criteria, leading to lower acceptance rates but also a lower
rate of reconstruction errors. Signal objects are used as the physical objects within this
work.


4.3.1     Event selection
Before being considered for analysis, data events need to pass the following set of event
cleaning criteria:

   • Good Runs List: Data events, where beam or detector conditions were not
     sufficient for physics analysis, are rejected. This information is stored in Good Runs
     Lists (GRL) and event-level detector flags.
   • Primary vertex: The primary vertex of an event is the vertex with the highest
       pT of its associated tracks. Only events with at least two tracks associated to
     P 2

     this vertex are kept, others are rejected.
   • Jet rejection: In order to reject events containing detector noise or other beam
     induced backgrounds, events are rejected if they do not pass the LooseBad quality
     criterion described in Ref. [54].
   • Bad Muon Veto: Events containing a bad muon are rejected. With the charge
     q and momentum p of the muon, as well as the uncertainty σ (q/p) on the q/p
     measurement, bad muons are muons with σ(q/p)
                                            |q/p|
                                                  > 0.2.
   • Cosmic Muon Veto: Events containing cosmic muons are rejected. Reconstructed
     muons are considered to come from cosmic radiation if the longitudinal z0 and
     transverse d0 impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex are z0 > 1 mm
     and d0 > 0.2 mm.


4.3.2     Electrons
Electrons are charged particles and thus are reconstructed from tracks in the ID and
energy deposits in the ECal [55]. The entries in the ECal are formed by clustering the
34                                                                The 1-lepton final state


deposits starting from seeds with an energy deposit of at least 2.5 GeV. The reconstructed
tracks are extrapolated to the middle layer of the ECal and matched to the clusters if
close enough in η and ϕ. The tracks of signal electrons are required to fulfil do /σd0 < 5
and ∆z0 sin θ < 0.5 mm, with d0 the transverse impact parameter, σd0 the uncertainty on
d0 and ∆z0 the distance between the nominal interaction point and the point at which
d0 is measured.
In order to discriminate electrons against background sources like HF hadron decays,
photon conversions or Dalitz decays, multiple electron identification working points
are defined [56]. The identification is based on a likelihood (LH) method and defines
loose, medium and tight working points with increasing background rejection power. In
this work, baseline electrons are required to pass the LooseAndBLayerLLH identification
criterion that takes the tracking information from the insertable B-Layer into account.
Signal electrons need to pass the tighter TightLLH working point in order to guarantee
a low misidentification rate necessary for physics objects. Electrons are furthermore
required to have a minimum pT of 7 GeV and |η| < 2.47.
Additionally, signal electrons are required to be isolated, meaning that the vicinity of
reconstructed electrons needs to be clear of other objects. This is verified by means
of two variables, one based on reconstructed tracks, the other based on calorimeter
entries. The track based isolation criterion pvarcone30
                                              T         is the sum of track momenta above
1 GeV (without the electron track) in a cone around the electron. The size of the cone
is chosen to be ∆R = min (10 GeV/pT , 0.3), i.e. decreases with increasing pT down
to a minimal size of 0.3. The calorimeter based variable ETtopocone20 is the sum of the
transverse energies in topological calorimeter clusters (again without the electron itself)
in a cone with ∆R = 0.2 around the lepton. In this work, signal electrons are required
to pass the GradientLoose requirement if the transverse momentum of the electron
satisfies pT ≤ 400 GeV and the FixedCutHighPtCaloOnly requirement otherwise. The
GradientLoose requirement makes η- and pT -dependent requirements on the two isolation
variables such that the efficiency is 95% at ET = 25 GeV and 99% at ET = 60GeV. The
FixedCutHighPtCaloOnly criterion requires that ETtopocone20 < 3.5 GeV. More details on
the different working points are given in Ref. [57].


4.3.3     Muons
Muons are reconstructed from their tracks in both the inner detector and the muon
spectrometer. In a first step, the muon tracks in the ID are reconstructed independently
from the reconstruction in the MS. After the separate reconstruction, a statistical
combination of both tracks is performed. In this work, both the baseline and signal muons
are required to pass the medium [58] muon identification requirement. In the region
with |η| < 2.5, the medium working point requires the combined muon tracks to have
at least 3 hits in at least two MDT layers. In the |η| < 0.1 region, tracks with at least
one MDT layer but not more than one MDT hole layer are allowed for combined tracks.
In the region 2.5 < |η| < 2.7 at least three MDT or CSC layers are required for tracks
4.3 Object definitions and event selection                                                 35


extrapolated from the MS. Additionally, the medium working point also requires the q/p
significance to be below 7. Baseline muons are also required to have a minimum pT of
6 GeV and |η| < 2.7. Signal muons need to have |η| < 2.5 and the impact parameters
need to fulfil do /σd0 < 3 and ∆z0 sin θ < 0.5 mm.
Similar to electrons, muons need to be isolated. Signal muons are required to pass the
GradientLoose requirement.


4.3.4     Jets
Quarks and gluons are colour-charged particles and can, due to colour-confinement, not
be detected individually. Instead, they hadronise† and form a collection of hadrons that
can be observed in the detector as so-called jets. Since the hadrons in a jet tend to be
boosted in the same direction, jets are in general cone-shaped. Two main approaches
of reconstructing jets exist. The most intuitive method is to use a bottom-up approach
that defines a cone with a certain radius R, then iteratively computes the sum of the
momenta of its constituents and uses the resulting direction as the centre of the next
cone in the iteration. This procedure stops once a stable cone has been found. However,
such a bottom-up approach has the disadvantage of being infrared and/or collinear
unsafe, meaning that it is not robust against adding a soft parton and/or splitting a
parton into two collinear partons. A way of circumventing this issue is by using the
top-down approach of a sequential recombination algorithm that iteratively recombines
the constituents of a jet until the remaining objects are too far away from each other.
In this work, jets are clustered by the anti-kt algorithm [59, 60], a sequential recombination
algorithm that is infrared and collinear safe. The topological clusters used as input for
the anti-kt algorithm are formed by a topological cell clustering algorithm [61] selecting
calorimeter cells with a certain threshold energy and signal-over-noise ratio as seeds and
clustering topologically connected cells that satisfy a set of conditions. A standard radius
parameter of R = 0.4 is used for the anti-kt algorithm.
Jets with pT < 50 GeV and |η| < 2.4 have to be matched to the primary vertex through the
jet vertex tagger (JVT) [62], suppressing jets from pile-up. Additionally, jets are calibrated
following the criteria in Ref. [63], which, among other things, includes corrections to
the jet energy and resolution. Furthermore, jets are required to have a minimum pT of
20 GeV and |η| < 4.5. Observables built from jets (e.g. the jet multiplicity) use central
jets with |η| < 2.8 and pT > 30 GeV.


4.3.5     B-tagging
As can be easily seen through the CKM matrix, the primary decay of the b-quark is into a
b-quark via b → W c. However, due to the small coupling constant ∝ Vcb § , the decay is so

    Except for the top quark because it is so massive that it decays before hadronising.
§
    Vcb is the entry in the CKM matrix corresponding to the b ↔ c transition.

slow that B-mesons have typical lifetimes of O (ps) [37], which is, in typical momentum
ranges of O (102 GeV), long enough to see displaced decay vertices in the detector.
In this work, b-jets are identified with the MV2 classifier [64], a multivariate discriminant
using boosted decision trees (BDT) in order to combine the output of three different b-
tagging algorithms. The first of these is an impact parameter based algorithm, the second
is a secondary vertex finder and the third is a multi-vertex reconstruction algorithm that
tries to reconstruct full b-hadron decay chains. The MV2c10 classifier is used to identify
b-jets by cutting on the output score such that the b-tagging efficiency is at 77% [64].


4.3.6       Missing transverse momentum
Since the exact momentum fraction of the colliding partons is unknown, momentum
and energy conservation cannot be used in the longitudinal direction, but only in the
transverse plane† . Therefore, particles escaping the detector without interaction lead to
a momentum imbalance in the transverse plane. The missing transverse momentum is
reconstructed by using the set of reconstructed and fully calibrated electrons, muons,
photons and jets (denoted as ξ in eq. (4.1)) as well as the tracks not associated to a
reconstructed object (track soft terms, TST) [65],

                                   pmiss =−                                                        (4.1)
                                               X               X
                                    T                pT,i −           pT,i .
                                               i∈ξ            i∈TST

The magnitude of the missing transverse momentum is denoted as the missing transverse
energy ETmiss ≡ |pmiss
                  T |.




4.4        Overlap removal
During the reconstruction procedure, it can happen that the same tracks or energy
deposits are reconstructed and identified as two separate physics objects. For example,
electrons tend to be clustered as well as jets and are therefore often also reconstructed as
a jet [66]. In order to prevent this kind of double-counting but also improve the isolation
of physics objects, an overlap
                        q       removal (OR) procedure is carried out on baseline objects.
The OR uses ∆R = (∆y) + (∆ϕ)2 as distance measure and applies the following
                               2

steps [46, 66]:

     1. If two electrons share the same ID track, then the one with the lower pT is discarded.

     2. Electrons sharing the same ID track with a muon are rejected.

     3. Non b-tagged jets within ∆R < 0.2 of an electron are rejected.

      Assuming that the initial momenta of the colliding partons in the transverse plane is negligible.

  4. Electrons overlapping with one of the remaining jets are removed. The cone size
     used to define the overlap is ∆R = min (0.4, 0.04 + 10 GeV/pT ), i.e. shrinks with
     increasing electron pT .

  5. Reject non b-tagged jets within ∆R < 0.2 of a muon or where muons have been
     matched to the jet through ghost association [67], a procedure that associates
     four-vectors of infinitesimal magnitude to tracks before using them in the jet
     reconstruction, preventing the tracks to change the properties of the calorimeter-
     based jets. A muon is matched with a jet if a ghost version of one of its partial
     tracks, reconstructed from hits in the MS, is contained in the jet after reclustering.

  6. Muons overlapping with a remaining jet are removed. The same shrinking cone size
     as for the electrons is used.

Statistical data analysis

In high energy particle physics,it is necessary to perform statistical data analysis in
order to get objective assessments of the observed data. Therefore, this chapter aims to
introduce the basic statistical concepts that are used for the signal region optimisation as
well as for the computation of the exclusion limits presented throughout this work. The
introduction to the statistical methods given in this chapter largely follows Refs. [68]
and [69].


5.1      Likelihood
In the statistical models used within this work, binned Likelihood fits are employed (see
sections 6.5 and 7.1.2 for details concerning the implementation). Each bin corresponds
to a kinematic region used in the analysis. In general, in the SUSY searches considered in
this work, three types of kinematic regions are designed: signal regions, control regions and
validation regions. Each region type can be composed of one or many bins. Signal regions
are phase spaces enriched in signal events, used to detect and study the signal processes.
Control regions are background-dominated regions that are used to estimate background
events in the signal regions by comparing the predicted events in each control region
with data and extrapolating correction factors to the signal regions. Finally, validation
regions are used to validate this extrapolation and are therefore typically placed in phase
spaces between the control and the signal regions.
In simple counting experiments where each event is independent from previous events,
each defined bin can be described by its own Poisson term. The Poisson probability to
observe k events with an expectation of λ is given by

                                                 λk −λ
                                     P (k|λ) =      e .                                (5.1)
                                                 k!
40                                                                                   Statistical data analysis


The total Likelihood is constructed through the product over all Poisson distributions
for each considered bin. The expectation λi in each bin i can be parametrised through
the introduction of a signal strength parameter µsig , yielding

                                              λi = µsig si + bi ,                                        (5.2)

where, for each bin i, si is the number of expected signal events and bi the number
of expected background events. This allows to use µsig as a free parameter in the fit,
with µsig = 0 being the background-only hypothesis and µsig = 1 corresponding to the
signal-plus-background hypothesis with the nominal cross-section considered in the model.
Since only positive signals are considered in this work† , the signal strength parameter is
constrained by µsig ≥ 0. The expected signal and background event yields generally depend
on a set of nuisance parameters θ (the bold font is used to emphasize the fact that this
is a set of parameters). Nuisance parameters that are directly constrained through data
observations in background-dominated control regions are called normalisation factors
µbkg . On the other hand, nuisance parameters can also be used to describe systematic
uncertainties α [46]. Each uncertainty is constrained by an auxiliary measurement
described by a unit Gaussian Gsys with central value α0 . In general, the likelihood can
be constructed by
                                                                                              
             L (µsig , µbkg , α) =            P (ki |λi (µsig , µbkg , α))           Gsys α0 |αj .       (5.3)
                                      Y                                      Y

                                     i∈bins                                  j∈sys

A single likelihood function can be built for the full set of signal, control and validation
regions used within an analysis.


5.2       Test statistics
Test statistics are a tool used in the evaluation of hypotheses. At the LHC, the definitions
of test statistics for hypotheses based on models that can be expressed through a likelihood,
use the profile likelihood ratio,
                                                                 
                                                            ˆ
                                                       L µ, θ̂
                                          λ (µ) =                .                                     (5.4)
                                                       L µ̂, θ̂

      ˆ
Here, θ̂ is the conditional maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator of θ, i.e. the value of θ
that maximises L for a given µ. The parameters µ̂ and θ̂ are the ML estimators for the
unconditionally maximised likelihood function. For the sake of notational conciseness,
µ ≡ µsig in the following.
†
     The presence of new physics can, in this work, only cause an increase in the number of total events.
5.3 p-values                                                                              41


In order to discover a new signal, i.e. rejecting the µ = 0 hypothesis, a one-sided discovery
test statistic q0 is built with λ (µ),
                                       
                                       −2 ln λ (0),        µ̂ ≥ 0,
                                q0 =                                                   (5.5)
                                       0,                  µ̂ < 0.

If the data presents fluctuations such that fewer events are seen than expected by only
considering background processes, then q0 = 0 and the background-only hypothesis
cannot be rejected. This is sensible since µ ≥ 0 and hence the observation of fewer events
than expected is not considered as evidence against the background-only hypothesis. In
case more events are seen than expected by background processes, this definition produces
increasingly large values of q0 , corresponding to an increasing level of incompatibility
between data and the background-only hypothesis.
If the background-only hypothesis cannot be rejected, the hypothesis test can be swapped
around and instead the signal-plus-background hypothesis can be tested. For this case,
the one-sided exclusion test statistic qµ is built,
                                       
                                       −2 ln λ (µ),        µ̂ ≤ µ,
                                qµ =                                                   (5.6)
                                       0,                  µ̂ > µ.

Setting qµ = 0 for µ̂ > µ (i.e. defining the test statistic to be one-sided) ensures that the
observation of more events than expected with the signal-plus-background hypothesis
is not considered as evidence against it. The test statistic qµ allows to establish upper
limits on the signal strength parameter and therefore is used to exclude signals.


5.3      p-values
In order to quantify the level of disagreement between the considered null hypothesis and
the observed data, a p-value can be computed. The p-value indicates the probability of
obtaining a similar or even more extreme outcome, often corresponding to higher values
of the test statistic. The p-value is therefore defined as the integral of the test statistic
distribution f (q|ξ) given certain model assumptions ξ ,
                                          Z ∞
                                    p=              f (q|ξ) dq.                        (5.7)
                                             qobs

The p-value is often interpreted in terms of Gaussian standard deviations through the
quantile function Φ−1 by

                                       Z = Φ−1 (1 − p) .                               (5.8)

The significance Z indicates how many Gaussian standard deviations the measured
value is away from the expected value. In order to claim a discovery, i.e. reject the
42                                                                         Statistical data analysis


background-only hypothesis, a significance of Z = 5 is needed. A significance of Z = 3 is
interpreted as evidence for the existence of a signal. In the case of very large background
b and low signal s, i.e. s ≪ b, the significance can be approximated through
                                            s
                                          Z=√ .                                                (5.9)
                                             b
A more accurate calculation also takes uncertainties on background events into account.
An implementation of this is given by the RooStats framework [70]:

            RooStats::NumberCountingUtils::BinomialExpZ(s,b,∆brel ),

where ∆brel is the total relative uncertainty on the background. In case both statistical
and systematic uncertainty are considered, the total relative background uncertainty can
be written as
                                          v
                                                       !2             !2
                                   ∆b         ∆bstat          ∆bsys
                                          u
                                          u
                         ∆brel   =    =   t
                                                            +              .                 (5.10)
                                    b          b               b

Based on previous experiences in the 1-lepton final state, a flat 30% systematic uncertainty
is, in this work, often taken as an approximation for a full evaluation of systematics.
In the case where the exclusion power for a signal is low, an underfluctuation of data
can cause the signal to be accidentally excluded. In order to prevent this, the exclusion
p-value ps+b is divided by 1 − pb , where pb is obtained from the exclusion test statistic
using µ = 0, resulting in a quantity called CLs ,
                                                 ps+b
                                      CLs =            .                                     (5.11)
                                                1 − pb
The signal-plus-background hypothesis is excluded by requiring CLs < 0.05, also referred
to as 95% confidence level (CL). All exclusion contours shown in this work are drawn at
95% CL.

Sensitivity studies for electroweak
Supersymmetry

As explained in chapter 4, events with one lepton in the final state are a powerful channel
for SUSY searches. Previous experiences with strong production signal models [26, 71]
have shown that it is possible to design an analysis that is sensitive to a multitude of
different production and decay modes. Unlike strong production models, electroweak
models have, in the past, often been beyond the reach of searches for SUSY due to
the lower cross-sections. With the growing amount of data collected by the ATLAS
detector, however, electroweak models are becoming increasingly interesting. Therefore,
this chapter presents efforts assessing the sensitivity of the 1-lepton channel to the generic
electroweak signal model χ̃±  1 χ̃1 → W W χ̃1 χ̃1 , a model that does not rely on distinctive
                                  ±          0 0

decays like e.g. h → bb̄. This model has been introduced in sections 1.2.6 and 4.1. All the
studies presented in this chapter are performed with MC simulations normalised to an
integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1 , which roughly corresponds to the currently projected
amount of data collected by ATLAS by the end of Run-2 [72].


6.1      Discriminating observables
In order to be able to distinguish supersymmetric events from SM processes, it is necessary
to use different discriminative observables. This section introduces the various observables
used to determine the sensitivity of the 1-lepton analysis to the W W model.
The plots in figs. 6.1 and 6.2 show exemplary kinematic distributions of each observable
introduced in the following. Both the distributions of the SM background (coloured areas)
and the SUSY signal (coloured lines) are shown, each normalised to unity in order to
emphasize the difference in shape of each distribution. While the different SM processes
are stacked on top of each other, the signal histograms are superimposed on the SM

background. Multiple benchmark signal points† with different χ̃±    1 and χ̃1 masses are
                                                                              0

shown, each following the naming convention ‘ m(χ̃±   1 ), m(χ̃1 ) ’, with both masses in
                                                               0

GeV. All distributions are shown after requiring exactly one lepton and at least two jets
with pT > 30 GeV as a preselection. In the following, the term cut refers to a lower or
upper requirement on a given observable.


Lepton and jet momenta

The supersymmetric particles in the decay chain of the considered signal model have, in
general, higher masses than most of the SM particles. In cases where the mass difference
between the χ̃01 and the χ̃±
                           1 is high, the particles originating from the supersymmetric
decays tend to have higher momenta than in many SM processes. Therefore, the transverse
momenta of the produced jets and the lepton, are considered to be promising observables
for discriminating against SM processes.
In more compressed scenarios, i.e. where the mass of the χ̃01 is closer to the mass of the
  1 , the transverse momenta have a lower importance since the produced particles in
χ̃±
the final state tend to have relatively low energies. Figures 6.1(a) to 6.1(c) illustrate the
discriminative power of the transverse momenta for different kinematic scenarios. In the
following, objects with high transverse momentum are often referred to as hard, while
objects with low transverse momentum are called soft.


Number of jets Njet

As can be seen in fig. 1.3(a), the final state of the considered WW model explicitly features
two jets originating from the decay of one W boson. By allowing a third additional jet in
the final state, e.g. due to ISR or FSR, and thereby requiring events to either have two
or three jets in the final state, it is possible to reduce the SM background.


Number of b-tagged jets Nb-jet

Similar to the total number of jets in the final state, the number of b-tagged jets is a
helpful observable allowing to differentiate SUSY processes from SM background. In SM
processes involving top quarks, the final state tends to have b-jets since the top quark
mainly decays into a bottom quark through t → W b. No explicit top quark appears in
the considered SUSY decay chain, thus the b-jet multiplicity is in general lower for this
SUSY model than for many SM events and an upper cut on the number of b-tagged jets
allows to suppress background processes involving top quarks.

     As explained in section 1.2.6, a signal point is an instance of the considered signal model with a
     given set of particle masses.

Figure 6.1: First set of observables used in the sensitivity studies. The backgrounds (coloured
areas) are stacked on top of each other and the total stack is normalised to unit area. The
signals (coloured lines) are superimposed and also normalised to unit area. As a consequence,
the difference in shape between the background and the signal for different observables is clearly
visible. The naming convention for the different signal points is (mχ̃± , mχ̃0 ), with both masses

Figure 6.2: Second set of observables used in the sensitivity studies. The backgrounds (coloured
areas) are stacked on top of each other and the total stack is normalised to unit area. The
signals (coloured lines) are superimposed and also normalised to unit area. As a consequence,
the difference in shape between the background and the signal for different observables is clearly
visible. The naming convention for the different signal points is (mχ̃± , mχ̃0 ), with both masses

Missing transverse energy ET

In SM processes, the missing transverse energy mainly stems from neutrinos escaping
the detector. Additional sources of ETmiss come from mismeasurements or errors in the
reconstruction.
For the SUSY processes considered, two neutralinos escape the detector in addition to the
neutrino. The SUSY processes thus tend to have a much higher ETmiss than SM processes,
such that a lower requirement on the ETmiss distribution separates SUSY events from SM
processes.


Missing transverse energy significance

Finite detector resolution can cause events without real ETmiss to receive some missing
transverse energy during reconstruction. This is called fake ETmiss and can have different
detector-related origins. For example, the momenta of particles (here especially jets)
can be mismeasured and entire particles can be incorrectly or not at all reconstructed,
resulting in fake ETmiss . Non-instrumented regions of the detector, where particles can
escape without being detected also contribute to fake ETmiss . The ETmiss significance S [73]
helps in rejecting events with fake ETmiss . Given a certain E missT   (the bold font is used
again for vectorial quantities), it tests the hypothesis that the total transverse momentum
carried by invisible particles pinvT is equal to zero against the hypothesis that pT is
                                                                                         inv

As can be seen in fig. 6.3(a), events with high fake ETmiss , i.e. events where the resolution
δETmiss = (ETmiss − ETmiss,truth )/ETmiss,truth has a high value, have a low ETmiss significance
value. A lower requirement on the ETmiss significance would thus get rid of most of the
events with high fake ETmiss . However, as fig. 6.3(b) shows, the missing transverse energy
itself reveals a similar behaviour, with objects with fake ETmiss accumulating at relatively
low ETmiss values. Taking into account the correlation between the missing transverse
energy and the ETmiss significance shown in fig. 6.3(c), it is not clear a priori that one
of the two observables will perform significantly better than the other. Thus, for the
purpose of comparison, both of them are used in the following.


Transverse mass mT

The transverse mass mT [74] is a powerful variable in the 1-lepton channel [26]. As can be
seen in equation (6.2), its computation closely follows the computation of the invariant

In most SM processes in the 1-lepton channel, both the lepton and the missing transverse
momentum originate from the decay of a W boson, hence the mT distribution has a
kinematic endpoint at the W boson mass. In the SUSY events considered in this work,
there are sources of ETmiss other than the decaying W boson, thus the mT distribution
is in general more spread out. As can be seen in fig. 6.2(c), the background rejection
power (at a given signal efficiency level) of mT is best for signal points with a high mass
difference between the χ̃±1 and the χ̃1 , i.e. for signal points where most of the missing
                                       0

transverse momentum is carried by the two neutralinos instead of the neutrino.


Effective mass meff

The effective mass meff is the sum of the missing transverse energy and the transverse
momenta of the lepton and the jets,

                                 meff = pℓT +           pT + ETmiss .                 (6.3)

Since SUSY particles are heavier than SM particles, their SM decay products tend to
be more energetic and consequently the effective mass is in general higher. Additionally,
the effective mass distribution is sensitive to the mass difference between the χ̃±   1 and
the χ̃1 . Despite the obvious correlation with the lepton and jet momenta as well as the
       0

ETmiss , all of which are already used as stand-alone observables, the meff is still used as
discriminative variable in the cut optimisation.


Distance between jets ∆Rjj

In case of a high mass differences between the χ̃±
                                                 1 and the χ̃1 , the W bosons often have
                                                             0

high momenta. As a result, the two jets originating from a hadronic decay of one of the
W bosons are often highly boosted in one direction, resulting in a small distance between
the two jets. The distance measure is defined by
                                          q
                                 ∆Rjj =       (∆ϕjj )2 + (∆ηjj )2 ,                   (6.4)

where ‘jj’ refers to the two leading jets (pT -wise). As fig. 6.1(d) shows, the distance
between the two leading jets tends to be higher in SM processes than in the SUSY events
considered. Additionally, it can be seen that ∆Rjj is less discriminative for compressed
signal points than for points with high mass differences between the χ̃±1 and the χ̃1 .

Figure 6.4: Different dijet mass definitions yield different distributions. Figure (a) shows the
distribution for an exemplary signal point, while fig. (b) shows the distribution for the total
SM background. Figure (c) shows a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing
the two variations.


Reconstructed mass of the dijet system

In the SUSY events considered, the hadronic decay of one of the W bosons is the
main source of jets in the final state. Taking two jets as a combined dijet system and
reconstructing the invariant mass mjj should therefore yield a peak around the W boson
mass. For background events, there are also other sources of jets apart from W bosons
decaying into jets. Thus, by simple combinatorial consideration, the reconstructed dijet
mass is expected to yield a broader distribution than for SUSY events. A window
cut around the W boson mass could therefore predominantly select signal events over
background events.
As many events have more than two jets in the final state, there is often no single way to
select the two jets that the invariant mass should be computed of. Figure 6.4 shows a
comparison of the different variations that are explored in the following. A first definition,
6.2 Optimisation methods                                                                              51


named mhad W , iterates over all the jets in an event and calculates the invariant mass of
the different possible dijet systems through their Lorentz vectors, finally taking the value
that lies closest to the W boson mass. This yields a distribution with a narrow peak at
the W boson mass for signal events, and a slightly broader peak for background events.
In a second variation the Lorentz vectors of the two highest energetic jets are used,
regardless of whether there are other jets in the event or not. This obviously results in a
higher rate of dijet systems not originating from the same W boson, causing the peak
around mW to be less pronounced in signal events (see fig. 6.4(a)). For background events,
however, fig. 6.4(b) shows that the peak around the W boson mass nearly completely
disappears.
In fig. 6.4(c), the background rejection rate is plotted against the signal efficiency† in a
so-called receiver operating characteristic curve (further explained in section 6.2.1). It
can be seen that for the high background rejection rate that is needed, mjj yields better
signal efficiencies and is therefore preferred over mhad
                                                     W .


                          miss
Angular distance between ET    and the lepton

Another interesting observable used to discriminate signal events from background events
is the angular distance between the ETmiss and the lepton. In background events, the ETmiss
and the lepton often originate from processes involving the decay of a W boson through
W → ℓν. As fig. 6.2(f) shows, W + jets events have a higher chance of a back-to-back
emission of the lepton and the neutrino, while, in the considered signal events, the ∆ϕ
distribution is in general more evenly spread out.


6.2      Optimisation methods
The two optimisation methods used in section 6.3 are based on the approach of max-
imising the expected discovery significance by appropriately modifying upper and/or
lower requirements on the observables presented in section 6.1. The first method is a
multidimensional scan over all the possible combinations of cuts on the used observables,
employed to scan a broad range of different kinematic regions. The second method uses
one-dimensional scans of each of the used observables while applying all the selection cuts
except for the cut on the scanned observable, especially useful for fine-tuning individual
requirements.


6.2.1     Multidimensional cut scan
A multidimensional cut scan on N observables, therefore also called an N -dimensional
cut scan, is the main optimisation method used in section 6.3. By carefully comparing
†
    The term signal efficiency denotes the rate of signal events that pass a given cut combination.
52                                     Sensitivity studies for electroweak Supersymmetry


with the distributions at preselection level shown in figs. 6.1 and 6.2, it is possible to
define a range of discrete cut values for each observable. Since the total number of cut
combinations increases rapidly when adding more cuts or variables to be scanned, the
ranges have to be chosen carefully. In the N -dimensional cut scan, for each possible
cut combination, the number of expected signal and background events, as well as the
statistical uncertainty of the background is calculated from the MC samples. As this
procedure takes a significant amount of time, it is important to restrict the number of cut
combinations to a manageable level. In practice, a total number of the order of 107 –108
cut combinations is still computationally feasible.
After determining the expected signal and background yields as well as the statistical
uncertainty for each cut combination, the different combinations are binned into a
predefined number of signal efficiency bins. For each signal efficiency bin, the background
rejection is subsequently maximised, i.e. the cut combination with the highest background
rejection is chosen as a candidate for the respective signal efficiency bin. This effectively
creates a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Since only a small subset of all
scanned cut combinations are selected as candidates and lie on the ROC curve, more
computationally intensive calculations can be performed.
A common problem with N -dimensional cut scans is overtightening the cuts compared
to the available MC statistics. As the cross sections of SM processes are many orders
of magnitude higher than those of SUSY processes, it is often necessary to apply tight
cuts on discriminative observables in order to isolate signal events from backgrounds.
However, due to the finite amount of MC statistics available to simulate both SM and
SUSY events, many of the more extreme cut combinations select kinematic regions where
not enough MC statistics is available to correctly simulate the kinematic distributions.
By maximising the background rejection, extreme cut combinations favour situations
where the mere lack of simulated MC background events produces a high significance
value. Significance values obtained from such regions are of course not trustworthy since
the obtained background estimation is not reliable. In order to avoid such situations, the
N -dimensional scan uses a train-test approach, very common in the machine learning field
(see e.g. [75, 76]). The available MC statistics are split in two statistically independent
datasets, allowing to have two independent significance values per cut combination as
well as two independent ROC curves. A large discrepancy between the two significance
values or the ROC curves is a strong indication for overtightening of cuts in the sense
that the applied cuts are too extreme for the available MC statistics in the respective
kinematic regions.
The implementation of N -dimensional cut scans with a train-test approach used within
this work is done with ahoi [77], a publicly available software package developed by
Nikolai Hartmann.
6.3 Cut optimisation                                                                              53


6.2.2     N-1 plots
Instead of using a brute-force algorithm to scan through a long list of possible combina-
tions, a more manual procedure can be used, called N-1 plots. Each of the N observables
is scanned in a one-dimensional plot and all the cuts except for the cut on the scanned
observable are applied. With this procedure, the impact of a cut on a single observable and
the reached significance value in dependence of the exact cut value can be investigated.
By repeating this process for each observable, it is theoretically possible to iteratively
approach a cut combination yielding comparable results to an N -dimensional scan. While
this iterative procedure allows to manually check the statistics and validity of the cut
combination at each step, in practice, it often fails to capture more complex correlations
between observables.
Therefore, in this work, N-1 plots are used as a complement to an N -dimensional cut
scan, allowing to verify and fine-tune the requirements obtained after the cut scan.


6.3      Cut optimisation

6.3.1     Setup and technical details
By examining the kinematic distributions shown in figs. 6.1 and 6.2, the cut ranges in
table 6.1 are chosen† . Except for the cuts on the jet multiplicity, each cut range features
a default requirement that allows the optimisation algorithm to optionally not apply a
cut at all on the respective observable. For example, a requirement on pℓT > 0 GeV is
always fulfilled§ and thus is the same as applying no lower requirement on pℓT at all.
Five different benchmark signal points with different χ̃± 1 and χ̃1 masses are used in order
                                                                  0

to get a first sensitivity estimation for models with varying kinematic properties (dictated
by the SUSY particle masses). The different signal points are chosen to be around the
currently expected exclusion limit for this model, set by an analysis searching for SUSY
in events with 2 leptons in the final state with 36.1 fb−1 of data [78]. Each signal point is
optimised separately in order to get independent significance estimations for the various
kinematic regimes in the signal grid. As will be shown in the following, W +jets is in many
kinematic regions the most dominant background, followed by diboson and tt̄ production.
Unfortunately, W + jets is also by far the most dominant source of statistical uncertainty.
Therefore, in order for a cut combination to be considered by the N -dimensional cut
scan, it is required to have at least ten unweighted Monte Carlo W + jets events with a
statistical uncertainty of less than 40% as well as a total statistical uncertainty on the
†
    In fact, the chosen cut ranges are subject to a previous manual optimisation procedure determining
    ideal ranges in terms of computational efficiency and obtained results.
§
    As described in sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, electrons (muons) used within this work are required to
    have a minimum pT of 7 GeV (6 GeV).

total MC background of less than 50%. Any cut combination not satisfying these criteria
is not considered when building the ROC curve.


6.3.2     Optimisation results
As explained in section 6.2.1, after the N -dimensional scan, the cut combinations are
sorted in bins of signal efficiency and only the candidates maximising the background
rejection and satisfying the statistical criteria introduced in section 6.3.1 are chosen. In
fig. 6.5, the expected significances for each signal point are plotted against the signal
efficiencies. Different uncertainty scenarios are used in order to get a more complete
picture of the possible sensitivity and help choosing a suitable cut combination for each
scanned signal point.
The first significance value (shown in blue) is computed with MC statistical uncertainty
only and therefore is useful in avoiding kinematic regimes with too low MC statistics.
The second significance value (red) is calculated with a systematic uncertainty of 30%,
completely ignoring MC statistical uncertainties. This is useful for estimating the sen-
sitivity of a potential future analysis with a given total uncertainty (typically in the
range of 30%) where the estimation of problematic SM backgrounds is not done solely
through MC but e.g. through a data-driven method, thereby at least partially avoiding
high statistical uncertainties from poor MC simulations. As the MC simulation of the
W + jets background suffers from high statistical uncertainties even in regimes with
relatively high statistics, it would be a candidate for a data-driven background estimation.
This significance variation thus aims to give a sensitivity estimation in a potential future

analysis, where the W + jets statistical uncertainties can be slightly reduced through
alternative estimation techniques or improved MC statistics.
The third and last significance variation (green) uses MC statistical uncertainties together
with a systematic uncertainty of 30% (added quadratically), thereby forming a worst
case scenario where the statistics issues with W + jets are not resolved and systematic
uncertainties are taken into account. Hence, this last variation provides an estimation
for a lower bound of the sensitivity that could be achieved even if no further effort is
invested in alternative background estimation methods† .
In addition to the different significances, the expected weighted background yields together
with the statistical uncertainty are shown (in grey). This is useful to cross-check the
background yields for different cut combinations. Each line in fig. 6.5 is drawn for both
the training and test samples. As can be seen in fig. 6.5(a), no sensitivity at all is expected
for the (200, 0) signal point. In the following, this benchmark point is therefore omitted.
The resulting cut combination for each remaining signal point is chosen by picking a
cut candidate from a signal efficiency bin that constitutes a compromise between the
two first significance variations. This is sensible, since the significance value only taking
30% systematic uncertainties into account is agnostic to high statistical uncertainties
†
     Given that a signal region with a systematic uncertainty of around 30% is used.

Table 6.3: Cut combinations optimised through a round of N-1 plots based on the cut
combinations listed in table 6.2. The cuts on meff , ∆Rjj and the ETmiss significance are removed

since they are found not to contribute noticeably to the significance (within the previously

observables. The significance Z includes a systematic uncertainty of 30%.

(apart from the statistics constraints applied during the optimisation itself), while the
significance value only taking into account MC statistical uncertainties does not properly
reflect analysis scenarios where MC statistics could be improved and/or other background
estimation methods are employed and systematic uncertainties also need to be considered.
By selecting a compromise signal efficiency bin in terms of background statistics and
significance value in fig. 6.5, the cut combinations in table 6.2 are chosen. In general, the
optimisation only reaches relatively low significances of up to roughly Z = 2, even though
optimising for 140 fb−1 of data. Since the cut combinations from the N -dimensional scan
have been chosen conservatively in terms of statistics, a second round of optimisation
through N-1 plots is performed. This allows to manually fine-tune and tighten the cuts
while ensuring that no kinematic region with too low statistics is selected.
A complete set of all the N-1 plots for each signal point and each observable is listed
in appendix A.1. These are used to further tune requirements or even remove some
of the cuts that do not noticeably contribute to an increase in sensitivity. Performing
this manual optimisation yields the N-1-optimised cuts and significance values listed in
table 6.3. The applied changes are the following. The ETmiss significance requirement is
removed from the cut combinations for each signal point since it is found not to contribute
to a higher significance value and is largely redundant to the cut on ETmiss . The same
holds for the meff requirement. As the various benchmark signal points tend to favour
different meff cuts due to varying meff shapes (especially visible in fig. 6.2(d)), the removal
of the requirement especially also allows the meff distribution to be used in a shape
fit in section 6.5. Finally, the cut on ∆Rjj is also removed since events with low ∆Rjj
are already selected through other, correlated cuts. N-1 plots of the cut combinations
obtained through the manual N-1-optimisation are shown in figs. 6.6 to 6.9.

Figure 6.6: N-1 plots for the tuned cuts on the (250, 60) benchmark point. The significance
in the lower pad is obtained by summing up all the events in the direction of the cut arrow and
includes 30% uncertainty. In fig. (f), both the upper and lower requirement are shown, but the
significance in the lower pad refers to scanning only the upper requirement.

Figure 6.7: N-1 plots for the tuned cuts on the (300, 0) benchmark point. The significance in
the lower pad is obtained by summing up all the events in the direction of the cut arrow and
includes 30% uncertainty. In fig. (f), both the upper and lower requirement are shown, but the
significance in the lower pad refers to scanning only the upper requirement.

Figure 6.8: N-1 plots for the tuned cuts on the (400, 0) benchmark point. The significance in
the lower pad is obtained by summing up all the events in the direction of the cut arrow and
includes 30% uncertainty. In fig. (f), both the upper and lower requirement are shown, but the
significance in the lower pad refers to scanning only the upper requirement.

6.4       Preliminary signal region definition
By comparing the cuts on the different observables for the various benchmark points
obtained in table 6.3, an attempt to consolidate them into a single signal region (SR) can
be made. As the remaining low-mass point with m(χ̃±  1 ) = 250 GeV and m(χ̃1 ) = 60 GeV
                                                                               0

reaches a considerably lower significance than the higher-mass and less compressed
points, the main focus for a signal region in this work lies on the high-mass points† .
For most of the observables, a compromise is straightforward to choose since similar
cut values are favoured. For the cuts on ETmiss and mT , a value of 200 GeV is chosen
as a compromise between the low- and high-mass benchmark points. The requirements
defining the preliminary signal region are given in table 6.4. N-1 plots are shown in
fig. 6.10.
Table 6.5 summarises the expected event yields and statistical uncertainties for each of
the considered backgrounds and the benchmark signal points in the signal region for
140 fb−1 . The most dominant background in terms of expected number of events is by far
W + jets, followed by diboson and tt̄ production. The significances given in table 6.5 are
calculated with an uncertainty of 30%. Although the statistical uncertainty of W + jets
alone is, with 31%, slightly higher than 30%, this value is motivated by the anticipation
that, in a future analysis, W + jets is not only estimated through MC but e.g. data-driven
methods. This would likely result in a reduction of the statistical uncertainty and yield
a more reliable estimation of the W + jets background. Additionally, slightly more MC
statistics will be available at a later stage of Run-2, further improving the reliability of
the background prediction.
The significances that are achieved with this relatively simple cut-and-count§ approach
reach up to Z = 2 for massless LSPs. Hence, some of the signal points with very low
LSP masses lie slightly above the Z = 1.64 limit (necessary for exclusion) and could
†
     In a full analysis, multiple signal regions could of course target different kinematic regimes.

thus potentially be excluded in a future analysis. However, none of them reach the
significance levels needed for discovery. Furthermore, as the LSP mass increases, the
reached significance rapidly drops, showing that this signal region is only sensitive to
relatively low LSP masses.


6.5      Multi-bin approach

6.5.1     Method
Instead of only evaluating the significance of a given signal model in a single signal
region bin, i.e. with a simple cut-and-count approach, it is possible to extract more
information about the distributions through the definition of multiple signal region bins
in dependence of a discriminating variable. Simultaneously fitting multiple signal region
bins (all orthogonal to each other) allows to, for example, explicitly consider the varying
shapes for signal and background distributions. Additionally, as seen in the previous
section, a single cut-and-count signal region cannot be sensitive to all possible kinematic
scenarios or even completely different decay chains. A multi-bin fit, however, in principle
allows to choose the binning in such a way that the sensitivity to other decay chains or
kinematic scenarios can be increased. As a result, multi-bin fits generally result in higher
sensitivities than a simple cut-and-count approach. In the following, a simultaneous fit in
multiple signal region bins will be referred to as a shape fit.

Requirements written in the middle of the table are applied to all loose SRs.

The technical implementation of the shape fits presented in this section is done through
HistFitter [79], a software package wrapping around the frameworks HistFactory [80]
and RooStats [70], which are based on RooFit [81] and ROOT [82, 83]. HistFitter
conveniently interfaces methods to perform binned likelihood fits as well as their statistical
interpretation and is the standard statistical tool employed in searches for SUSY at
ATLAS.
As a shape fit needs a reliable background estimation in multiple bins (as opposed to a
single bin in a cut-and-count approach), it is necessary to slightly loosen some of the cuts
defining the SR from section 6.4 before binning the distribution of the observable used for
the multi-bin fit. In the following, shape fits on four different discriminative observables
are investigated: mjj , meff , mT and ETmiss . By carefully comparing with fig. 6.10, and
testing multiple different loose signal region candidates for each observable, the loose
SRs in table 6.6 are selected. For each observable, the loose SR in table 6.6 represents
the tested SR candidate yielding the best results in a shape fit.


6.5.2         Setups and results
Figures 6.11 to 6.13 illustrate the shape fit setups in each distribution for the various
benchmark signal points before simultaneously fitting all bins in each setup in a model-
dependent† fit. In each setup, the signal events are stacked on top of the total background
and the data points are ‘fake’ data used in the fit. In order to compute a discovery
significance, the discovery test statistic built from the profile likelihood ratio, introduced
in section 5.1, is used. In each setup, the statistical uncertainty from the MC samples as

       A model-dependent fit is used to either derive exclusion limits on a given signal model or quantify
       the properties of an excess over the number of events given by the background-only hypothesis [79].

Figure 6.11: Setup of a shape fit in mjj in the loose SR. The setup defines five bins in mjj
from 70 GeV to 100 GeV with a width of 6 GeV each, and includes MC statistical uncertainty
as well as 30% overall systematic uncertainty, uncorrelated over all bins. All five bins are fit
simultaneously in a model-dependent fit. The data points are ‘fake’ data used in the fit. In each
plot, the benchmark signal point considered in the fit is stacked on top of the total background.

Figure 6.12: Setup of a shape fit in meff in the loose SR. The setup defines four bins in
meff from 600 GeV to 1100 GeV with a width of 125 GeV each, and includes MC statistical
uncertainty as well as 30% overall systematic uncertainty. Overflow is included in the last bin.
All four bins are fitted simultaneously in a model-dependent fit. The data points are ‘fake’ data
used in the fit. In each plot, the benchmark signal point considered in the fit is stacked on top
of the total background.

Figure 6.13: Setup of a shape fit in mT in the loose SR. The setup defines four bins in mT
from 100 GeV to 500 GeV with a width of 100 GeV each, and includes MC statistical uncertainty
as well as 30% overall systematic uncertainty. Overflow is included in the last bin. All four bins
are fitted simultaneously in a model-dependent fit. The data points are ‘fake’ data used in the
fit. In each plot, the benchmark signal point considered in the fit is stacked on top of the total
background.

well as a 30% overall systematic uncertainty on the background is taken into account. In
HistFitter, this is introduced through a systematic of the type overallSys [79].
The achieved discovery significances for each benchmark point in every investigated
shape fit setup is shown in table 6.7. For high-mass points, the shape fit on mjj yields
the lowest significances, while the shape fit on mT generally outperforms other setups.
The results from fits on the meff - and ETmiss -shape lie more or less between the fits in
mjj and mT . Although the overall sensitivity is still relatively low, a significant increase
compared to the cut-and-count approach in section 6.4 is observed in the mT shape fit,
especially considering that both MC statistical and 30% overall systematic uncertainty
are considered. Although no signal point exceeds the 3σ limit needed to claim evidence
for SUSY in case of an excess, several signal points exceed the 1.64σ limit needed for
exclusion in case no excess in data is seen.
Figure 6.15 shows an interpolation of the achieved significances in the χ̃±1 –χ̃1 mass plane,

performed with Delaunay triangles, implemented with ROOT and shows a rough estimation

roughly 40 GeV could potentially be excluded. Section 6.7 further discusses these results.


6.6      Multivariate approach
Another method that could be able to successfully discriminate signal against background
events is a multivariate analysis. In this section, the sensitivity results using machine
learning algorithms, especially multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) [75, 76], a special form
of neural nets, are presented. Machine learning is a promising area in the artificial
intelligence domain and is successfully used to let machines learn patterns and structures
in data. In this work, MLPs are used to differentiate background from signal events with

6.6.1     General method and technical details
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of artificial neural networks. Neural networks
are based on a collection of connected nodes, called neurons, that are ordered in multiple
layers and designed to loosely model the neurons of the brain. The connections between
the neurons are similar to synapses in the brain in the sense that they transmit information
between the connected neurons. Each connection has an individual weight parameter
indicating the strength of the connection. Additionally, neurons have a threshold (or
bias) parameter that needs to be exceeded for the neuron to become active and transmit
information. MLPs are feedforward neural nets, meaning that information can only travel
in the forward direction† . Information is introduced in the MLP through an input layer
and travels through multiple hidden layers before reaching an output layer where the
final output score is determined. An activation function dictates how each neuron treats
information before transmitting it to each connected neuron in the next layer.
As the target of the MLP in this work is to distinguish between background and signal
events§ , a binary classification is employed. Therefore, the output layer, consisting of

    It does not matter which background process an event belongs to as long as it is correctly classified
    as being a background event.

only a single neuron, uses a sigmoid as activation function,
                                                  1
                                     σ (x) =           .                               (6.5)
                                               1 + e−x
The sigmoid has a lower bound at 0 for x → −∞ and an upper bound at 1 for x → ∞.
Hence, the output neuron associates a continuous score between 0 and 1 to each event,
with 0 being background and 1 signal processes. The neurons in the other layers use the
(noiseless) rectified linear unit function (ReLU) as activation function,

The MLP used in the following, is trained with a supervised learning method, which
means that labelled data is used to train the neural net. Labelled data is built of pairs of
data consisting of an input object and a desired output value, used to give feedback to
the algorithm during the training process. This is achieved through a procedure called
backpropagation [84]. The used measure indicating how well the algorithm learns from
the training data is the loss function, a quantisation of the difference between the desired
output and the output computed by the algorithm. The binary cross entropy is used as
loss function in this work. The training effectively consists of finding a global minimum
in the multidimensional distribution of the loss function by iteratively adjusting the
thresholds and weights of each neuron in such a way that a descent in the loss function
gradient takes place. The algorithm responsible for the gradient descent is called optimiser.
In the following studies, the Adam optimiser [85] is used. The implementation [86] of the
MLP is done with the Keras [87] framework using TensorFlow [88] as backend.
The performance of the different setups is mainly assessed by comparing their respective
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In a ROC curve, the background rejection
is plotted against the signal efficiency. The higher the background rejection is throughout
the entire range of signal efficiency, the better is the performance of the respective setup.
Thus, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a good indicator for how well a setup is
able to classify signal and background events. An AUC of 1.0 equals perfect classification
while an AUC of 0.5 is no better than luck. Since not all signal efficiency and background
rejection values are of interest, it is also important to not only compare the AUC but
also in which signal efficiency range a specific setup outperforms in terms of background
rejection.


6.6.2     Input data
The data used as input for the neural net are the MC samples for the different background
processes considered previously as well as the (400, 0) signal point. In general, machine
learning algorithms require high statistics samples to infer patterns and structures from
data. While the number of unweighted MC events is of the order of 106 -107 for background
6.6 Multivariate approach                                                                   73


events, the signal sample statistics are often only of the order of 103 events, which is not
enough for neural nets to learn the distinct characteristics of signal events. Furthermore,
producing several millions of events at full-reconstruction level (reco) takes a significant
amount of CPU time, even if using AtlFast-II, and is thus why it is not practicable to
produce enough signal MC statistics at full-reconstruction level for machine learning
studies. Therefore, in the following, a high statistics signal sample at truth level — a
sample missing the full detector simulation — is used to train the neural nets. Truth
samples can be easily generated but have the disadvantage of not accurately simulating
data due to the missing detector simulation. In order to reduce the mismodelings, a
dedicated approximation technique is used, smearing the distributions of the energies
and momenta of the physics objects used and applying reconstruction and identification
efficiencies binned in η and ϕ. This smearing technique is implemented in the software
framework SimpleAnalysis [89] and is explained in detail in section 7.1.1, where it
will be heavily reused. Testing the neural net is done on the low statistics sample with
fully reconstructed events. For the background, both training and testing use fully
reconstructed samples as enough MC background statistics are available.
A summary of plots comparing the agreement between the truth and full-reconstruction
signal samples is given in appendix A.2. In general the observables used in the following
for training and evaluating the MLP show a good agreement between full-reconstruction
and smeared truth samples.


6.6.3     Setup
A range of different setups and architectures are tested. The results from previous
studies [90, 91] using MLPs trained on truth-level events are partially used to choose
some of the setups to be tested. The performance of the different setups is assessed by
comparing their respective ROC curves. In order to avoid biases, only events not used
for training are considered for drawing the different curves. It is worth noting that not
the entire ROC curve is of interest. For the considered WW signal model, in order to
achieve sensitivity, the previous results in this chapter have shown that the background
efficiency needs to be roughly of the order of 10−4 while the signal efficiency should still
be high enough, i.e. in the range of 0.1 or higher.


Preselection cut

With a few million truth level signal events available, it is challenging to load all available
background and signal events into memory. Instead of randomly picking a subset of events
for both signal and background, different preselection cuts are studied. The advantage of
a preselection cut is that it not only reduces the memory load but also already favours
an interesting kinematic region. Figure 6.16 shows the impact of different preselection
cuts. It can be seen that in the relevant regions of the ROC curves, a preselection
on mT > 110 GeV slightly outperforms all the other tested preselection cuts. In the

Figure 6.16: Impact of different preselection cuts on the performance of the MLP. It can be
seen that, for high background rejection, the step 10 (randomly picking 1 out of 10 events) shows
the lowest signal efficiency. In signal efficiency regions larger than 0.2, the ∆Rjj preselection
cuts underperform significantly. Overall, a preselection on mT > 110 GeV is found to yield the
best results.


following, signal and background events will therefore only be considered if they satisfy
mT > 110 GeV.


Input observables

Another parameter of interest is the set of observables that are used to train and
evaluate the MLP. Again, different setups are tested and compared with the help of their
respective ROC curves. In the following, two main different sets of input observables are
distinguished: low-level and high-level quantities.
Low-level observables are the four-momentum components of the lepton and the two first
jets as well as ETmiss and ϕ(ETmiss ):

     • ETmiss , ϕ(ETmiss ),Njet , Nb-jet , pℓT , ϕℓ , η ℓ , pjet1
                                                             T , ϕ
                                                                  jet1
                                                                       , η jet1 , pjet2
                                                                                   T , ϕ
                                                                                        jet2
                                                                                             and η jet2 .

As an MLP is not able to deal with varying lengths of input parameters (not all event
contains the same number of jets), only the first two jets are included. In the simplified
model considered in this chapter, it can be expected that most of the information about
the event is already included in the two leading jets. In order to include at least some
information about additional jets, the total number of jets Njet and the total number of
b-tagged jets Nb-jet are also included.
6.6 Multivariate approach                                                                  75


The term high-level denotes observables that have been constructed through combination
of low-level observables, as for example the calculation of mT through pℓT and pmiss
                                                                                  T .
High-level observables are, if not otherwise stated, the following quantities:

   • ETmiss , mT , mjj , meff , ∆Rjj , Njet , Nb-jet .

In principle, the above set of low-level observables contains all information necessary
to reproduce the set of high-level quantities. Using low-level observables as input for
the MLP could therefore not only result in a neural net reconstructing discriminative
high-level observables like meff or even mT , but also in a situation where the MLP starts
exploiting even more correlations that have not yet been considered in previous studies.
Figure 6.17(a) however shows that, although an MLP trained only on low-level observables
as input is able to discriminate signal events against background events, using high-
level quantities as input performs noticeably better. This shows that the tested MLP
architectures are not yet able to use the full discriminative power supplied by the
high-level variables. Training the MLP on the combination of both high- and low-level
observables yields, for most parts of the ROC curve, better results than high-level
quantities only, illustrating that there is still discriminative information in the four-
momentum components not already exploited by the high-level quantities.
In the following, the high-level quantities extended by the transverse momenta of the
lepton and the two leading jets are used for training the MLP. Figure 6.17(a) shows that
this yields roughly the same ROC curve as the full combination of high- and low-level
observables, while allowing faster computation times due to the reduced number of input
variables.
It is important to note that there is still a possibility, that even more complex architectures
like recurrent neural networks [75, 76] or further optimised MLPs (e.g. through a hyper-
parameter scan) could yield setups where low-level observables are comparable to or even
outperform high-level quantities.


Network architecture

Although the exact network architecture plays a subordinate role for the final results
(given that it is not too simple nor too complex), different MLP sizes are tested. Even
though neural nets with very low numbers of neurons or layers can be trained in short
periods of time, they generally underperform compared to larger networks as they fail to
learn more complex features in data. With an increasing number of neurons and layers,
however, the parameter space rapidly grows, causing the need for an increasingly large
computational effort in order to train the networks. Choosing a suitable size optimises
both computational efficiency and discriminative power of the resulting network.
Figure 6.17(b) compares different architectures, all trained with the set of high-level
observables complemented by the transverse momenta. Up to a certain complexity,
the MLPs yield increasingly good results. However, there seems to be an optimal size,

     In fig. (b), the nomenclature for each setup is ‘layers x nodes’, e.g. three layers and 64 nodes in
     each layer is written as ‘3x64’. For each setup, the area under the curve (AUC) is stated. The
     preselection cut of mT > 110 GeV is applied in every setup.


     after which the results of the MLP start worsening again if the complexity is further
     increased. In the following, an MLP with 3 hidden layers and 64 nodes in each layer is
     chosen. Previous studies [90, 91] have also shown that this size constitutes a powerful
     general-purpose setup.

    The MLP is trained for a maximum of 30 epochs with a batch size of 128 events, but
    is stopped early if the loss function of the validation set† is not decreasing for three
    consecutive epochs, which helps to prevent overtraining.
     In fig. 6.18(b), the distribution of the output score for both signal and background is
     shown. For illustration purposes, the output-score is spread out through the inverse of
     the sigmoid function. The full-reconstruction signal sample is evaluated with an MLP
     that has been trained on the truth signal sample and only test events are used to evaluate
     the scores in order to prevent biases.
     Figure 6.18(a) shows the ROC curves obtained with the same MLP with truth train and
     truth test samples. As no significant difference between the test and training curve is
     seen, there is likely no noticeable overtraining.

                           The validation set is split of from the training set and used for validating the training between
                           epochs.

Figure 6.18: Results of a neural net trained on truth-level signal events and tested on full-
reconstruction-level signal events. Background events are at full-reconstruction-level both during
the training and the testing step. Figure (a) shows the ROC curves from both test and training.
As both curves completely overlap, no overtraining has occurred. Figure (b) shows the output
score distribution for both background and signal test events together with a significance scan,
including statistical uncertainty only. For illustration purposes, the output score is spread out
with the inverse of the sigmoid function.


Cut-and-count evaluation

With a simple cut-and-count approach, shown in the lower pad of fig. 6.18(b), a maximum
significance of Z = 1.31 (only taking into account MC statistical uncertainty) can be
reached by cutting on the output score at a value of greater than 8.4. No other cuts,
except for the preselection cuts (exactly 1 lepton, at least two jets and mT > 110 GeV)
are applied. Table 6.8 summarises the achieved significance value for different uncertainty
scenarios. The resulting event yields are in general higher than in the preliminary SR
obtained through a multidimensional cut scan, leading to lower statistical uncertainties
and fluctuations. However, in such a high yield region, a systematic uncertainty of
30% drastically reduces the significance as it often completely encompasses the signal.
Comparing with relatively high statistics signal regions of the previous 1-lepton analyses,
a systematic uncertainty of 10% is considered to be still a realistic scenario for a region
with such high event yields. This scenario, however, still only yields a significance of
Z = 0.89.
In summary, no increase in sensitivity is seen compared to the signal region obtained
with the N -dimensional cut scan in section 6.4. This is surprising as both approaches
essentially use the same input information and therefore a neural net is expected to
reach at least the same significance value as a brute-force scan. In the studies presented
here, this is not the case. It is, however, possible, that more complex architectures as e.g.

recurrent neural nets [75] are necessary for an algorithm to learn the distinct features of
this generic SUSY model. Further conclusions are discussed in section 6.7.


Multi-bin evaluation

Similar to what has been discussed in section 6.5, a simultaneous likelihood fit in multiple
bins of the output score distribution (spread out with the inverse of the sigmoid) is
investigated. The output score distribution (again spread out through the inverse of
the sigmoid) is divided into five bins ranging from values of 6 to 11, including overflow
events in the last bin. Figure 6.19 shows the distribution of the background with the
signal events stacked on top. As before, MC statistical uncertainty as well as a systematic
uncertainty on the shape of the distribution are considered.
With this setup, a discovery significance of 2.15σ (2.26σ) is reached when considering
an overall systematic uncertainty of 30% (10%) as well as MC statistical uncertainty.
This is an improvement compared to the previous cut-and-count evaluation on the

no significant sensitivity improvement compared to cut-based techniques is obtained
within this work.


6.7      Discussion
In this chapter, different attempts to estimate the sensitivity of the 1-lepton channel
to a generic electroweak pair production SUSY model have been presented. Although
targeting an integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1 and using analysis techniques with varying
degrees of complexity, the reached significance values for the considered benchmark points
are in general relatively low.
A first approach uses an N -dimensional cut scan and estimates the significance values
in a preliminary signal region with a cut-and-count approach in a single signal region
bin. The reached sensitivity is mainly limited by the available MC statistics for W + jets,
the dominant background in the region of interest. By adding a multi-bin shape fit in a
discriminative observable and slightly relaxing some of the signal region requirements, it
is possible to further increase the sensitivity, even though considering both MC statistical
uncertainties and an overall systematic uncertainty of 30%. With the currently available
MC statistics and a shape fit in the mT distribution, it could be possible to exclude signal
points with χ̃±1 masses between 300 GeV and 500 GeV and χ̃1 masses of up to (roughly)
                                                          †      0

40 GeV. Compared to the exclusion limits obtained by the 2-lepton search, an analysis
searching for the same simplified model in events with two leptons [78], the introduced
shape fit on mT can exclude slightly higher χ̃±   1 masses , but only lower χ̃1 masses.

Additionally, machine learning algorithms have been investigated as a tool to discriminate
the SUSY signal against SM background. In this work, multilayer perceptrons, a special
architecture of neural nets, are used. Although machine learning is a promising tool in
many fields of research, no significant increase in sensitivity is obtained in this work
for the WW model, even if fitting the shape of the output score of the neural net.

    of 300 GeV and 500 GeV respectively, however, due to missing benchmark points in these regions, it
    is not possible to make any definite statements.

80                                    Sensitivity studies for electroweak Supersymmetry


An interesting extension to the studies presented here would be to investigate more
complex architectures and whether or not it is possible that machine learning algorithms
learn high-level correlations (e.g. mT or meff ) purely from low-level information [92] (the
four-momenta of the physics objects). In this work and other recent studies [90, 91],
neural nets trained on low-level information have not yet been able to fully exploit or
even outperform the discriminative power of high-level quantities like the transverse mass.
Nevertheless, it could in principle be possible to improve this by more complex setups
not considered in this work.
In summary, the best approach for searching for the W W model in the 1-lepton channel
seems to be through a shape fit setup in a discriminative variable like e.g. mT . It is
not surprising to see that, due to the missing h → bb̄ decay, the sensitivity to the
W W model is significantly weaker than to the W h model, even when using advanced
analysis techniques and optimising for 140 fb−1 of data. However, the added advantage
of interpreting data with the W W model is an increased model independence due to
the generic nature of the model. Although designing a complete analysis using the W W
model would be challenging, the presented studies have shown that it is in principle
possible to achieve exclusion for certain non-compressed model points. With more MC
statistics available at a later stage in Run-2 of the LHC, as well as the use of data-driven
methods, the estimation of the mT shape for the background, especially for W + jets, can
become more reliable. This could lead to lower statistical uncertainties and potentially
further increase the sensitivity of a shape fit setup.

Sensitivity of the 1-lepton analysis
to the phenomenological MSSM

As explained in section 1.2.7, the reduced parameter space in the phenomenological
MSSM (pMSSM) is, with some additional requirements (explained in section 7.4.1),
small enough to be systematically scanned and compared to ATLAS data. Although
simplified models are often a very useful method to capture a wide range of different
phenomena, they evidently fail to capture more complex effects resulting from a larger
set of parameters and could assert relationships between SUSY parameters that are not
realised in nature. Sampling a more complete portion of the model space of the MSSM,
as e.g. the pMSSM, is therefore appealing.
In Run-1 of the LHC, a pMSSM scan [28] including signal regions from a multitude of
different SUSY searches has been performed. Amongst other things, it showed that, for
the strong 1-lepton analysis, there are significant differences between the nominal results
of the search using simplified models and the results to the pMSSM itself. As it turns
out, the discrepancies are mostly caused by the use of different signal regions as well as
different implementations of the statistical analysis. For this reason, efforts to improve
the representation of the 1-lepton analysis in the Run-2 pMSSM scan are presented in
the following.


7.1     Motivation and procedure
Compared to other searches for gluinos and squarks, the Run-1 strong 1-lepton analysis [71]
showed a competitive sensitivity to different decay topologies. This was, however, not
reflected in the Run-1 pMSSM scan, as the strong 1-lepton analysis revealed a reduced
sensitivity compared to other analyses.
Previous studies [93] have already shown that the main reason for the large difference in
performance is the fact that the Run-1 pMSSM scan did not use the shape fits in meff
82                     Sensitivity of the 1-lepton analysis to the phenomenological MSSM


implemented in the nominal analysis, but rather ‘discovery’ signal regions with a single
meff bin, thereby applying a simpler cut-and-count evaluation of the significance instead
of using the meff -shape information.
Similar to the pMSSM scan in Run-1 of the LHC, there are ongoing efforts for a Run-2
pMSSM scan. The goals of the scan are not only to search for SUSY in a larger parameter
space and to assess the combined sensitivity of the searches considered in the scan,
but also to provide input to the design of future analyses and identify possible blind
spots in the parameter space not yet covered by analyses. Up to now, still only the
discovery signal regions (defined in section 7.1.2) of the Run-2 strong 1-lepton analysis
were implemented instead of the shape fit used in the nominal analysis. As multi-bin
fits generally achieve better sensitivity than simple cut-and-count approaches with single
bin fits, the implementation of a shape fit for the strong 1-lepton analysis in the Run-2
pMSSM scan is expected to significantly improve the performance of the analysis in the
scan.
Since a pMSSM scan samples SUSY models over a vast parameter space, a large amount
of model points† (105 to 106 different points) have to be produced, thus preventing
the use of a time-consuming full detector reconstruction. Most sampled signal points
are therefore truth-level samples that have only been corrected through the smearing
procedure described in section 7.1.1 in order to consider a minimal detector response
approximation and increase the reliability of the results. Hence, in order to successfully
implement a shape fit for the 1-lepton analysis in the pMSSM scan, it is of central
importance that the shapes of the truth-level distributions match the shapes on full-
reconstruction (reco) level. Furthermore, since the scan has to be as CPU-effective as
possible, a short completion time has to be achieved for the fit, while still considering a
realistic systematic uncertainty scenario and a reliable background prediction§ .
Figure 7.1 schematically summarises the procedure used to verify that a simplified shape
fit setup applied on truth samples can indeed successfully reproduce the results of a
shape fit on fully reconstructed samples considering all systematic uncertainties. The
first step of the procedure compares the distributions between reco and truth samples
at preselection and in the signal regions and, if necessary, applies smearing techniques
in order to improve the agreement. In a second step, a simplified shape fit setup is
applied both on truth and full-reconstruction samples. The resulting exclusion contour
is compared with the contour from the Run-2 strong 1-lepton analysis [26], obtained
with shape fits in meff including all systematic uncertainties and performed on fully
reconstructed MC samples. More details on the shape fit and the employed signal regions
are given in section 7.1.2. A good agreement needs to be found between the results of
the analysis and the results obtained using a simplified shape fit and smeared truth
†
     Again, a model point is a given model with a unique set of model paramaters, which is not feasible
     for a scan over up to 106 points.
§
     A shape fit with full consideration of systematic uncertainties and background estimation through
     a set of control regions takes, in this case, multiple hours per signal point.

samples in order for the procedure to yield any meaningful results when applied on a
large number of pMSSM models.


7.1.1     Smearing algorithms
The smearing of truth samples is implemented with SimpleAnalysis [89], a software
package that uses specialised functions developed for ATLAS upgrade studies. The general
idea of the smearing procedure is to use results from the combined performance (CP)
groups in ATLAS in order to construct approximate parametrisations for reconstruction
and identification efficiencies as well as scale factors. Additionally, the energies of the
truth objects are smeared with a Gaussian term with a standard deviation corresponding
to the energy resolution of the detector, depending on η and pT and the reconstructed
physics object type. In this work, truth electrons, truth muons, truth jets and the truth
missing transverse energy are smeared.
For truth electrons, the identification efficiencies depend on η and pT as well as on the
reconstruction working point used. The η-dependency is implemented through several
η bins with a fixed width. For the pT -dependency, a linear interpolation between two
adjacent values is used to get the efficiency value for each electron. The rate at which
fake electrons are reconstructed in true jets is calculated through ‘fake rates’ depending
again on η, pT and the isolation working point used. The range of the pT interpolation
for both identification and isolation efficiencies extends from 7 GeV to 120 GeV. If an
electron is outside of that range, the efficiency values for the respective bound of the
84                      Sensitivity of the 1-lepton analysis to the phenomenological MSSM


range are used† . The energy of the truth electron is subsequently smeared through a
Gaussian term with a mean corresponding to the truth value and a standard deviation
equal to the energy resolution that depends again on η and pT .
In the case of truth muons, the identification efficiencies are only binned in η with
different values depending on the working point used. As before, the transverse energy of
the truth muon is smeared with a Gaussian term. The mean of the Gaussian is equal to
the true transverse energy value while the resolution is approximated separately for the
barrel and the endcap regions.
The energy of truth jets is smeared with a Gaussian term using a resolution approximation
based on five η bins ranging from |η| = 0 to |η| = 4.5. Only jets with a truth pT between
10 GeV and 1500 GeV are smeared. For jets with a truth pT > 20 GeV, the flavour-
tagging efficiencies for the different tagging working points are approximated using values
measured from a fully reconstructed tt̄ MC sample. This includes the tagging efficiencies
for light-, bottom-, charm- and tau-jets and, in this work, allows a significantly more
realistic simulation of the b-jet multiplicity.
Finally, the smeared missing transverse energy is computed using the transverse momenta
of the smeared truth objects and an approximation for the track soft terms (TST).

7.1.2      Simplified shape fit
In the Run-2 strong 1-lepton analysis, four different signal regions§ (SRs) are used to be
sensitive to different gluino and squark pair-production models. One of the considered
models is the gluino one-step model considered in this chapter. Table 7.1 summarises the
different signal regions. Among the observables used to define the SRs is the aplanarity, a
quantity that is defined to be 3/2 of the third eigenvalue of the sphericity tensor [94] and
indicates how spherical the distribution of the momenta of the particles in each event
is [46]. Since SUSY events are often characterized by decays into multiple hard objects,
they tend to have a more spherical distribution of momenta. In table 7.1, two different
signal regions requiring four to five jets are defined, differentiated by a high-x and a low-x
†
     For an electron with pT = 150 GeV, the same fake rate as for electrons with pT = 120 GeV is used.
§
     Apart from the SRs summarised in table 7.1, another SR targeting events with at least 9 jets is
     designed in the analysis. Since this 9J SR is not orthogonal to the 6J SR, it cannot be simultaneously
     fitted but rather needs an independent shape fit. In the following, the 9J SR will therefore not be
     included.

Factoring in the subdivisions in regions requiring at least one b-tagged jet (b-tag region)
and regions requiring no b-tagged jet (b-veto region) as well as the different meff -bins in
each SR, a total of 28 SR bins arise. Since each SR bin is completely orthogonal to every
other bin, a simultaneous likelihood fit in all bins can be performed. In the full analysis,
the background prediction in the SRs is obtained by a simultaneous fit in all bins in the
control regions (CRs).
In the simplified shape fit setup used within this chapter, control regions are used to
obtain the background estimates nor complete treatment of systematic uncertainties is
included. Instead, the fitted background yields in the SRs and their uncertainties are
taken from a previous simultaneous fit in the CRs and the SRs (ignoring the signal),
performed by the analysis. The results of this background-only fit are available in the
auxiliary material of the published results [26]. The statistical model is subsequently
approximated by taking, for each SR bin, the total background yields and the total
uncertainty and assuming that the uncertainties are completely correlated over all bins.
Similar to the full fit in the analysis, the simplified setup performs a simultaneous fit in
all 28 SR bins. With this setup, the expected and observed (using data corresponding to
36.1 fb−1 ) CLs values for signal points can be determined.
Since the detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties is responsible for the majority
of the CPU-time necessary to complete the original fits in the published analysis, this
approach, combined with the omission of the CRs, guarantees the short completion time
86                   Sensitivity of the 1-lepton analysis to the phenomenological MSSM


(of the order of a few seconds as opposed to multiple hours per signal point) needed for
an extensive scan over the full pMSSM parameter space. As before in chapter 6, the
shape fit is implemented using HistFitter.


7.2      Truth- and reco-level comparisons
This section compares truth- and full-reconstruction-level distributions both after applying
a basic preselection and in the different SRs used in the strong 1-lepton analysis.


7.2.1     Comparison at preselection level
The applied preselection requires exactly one signal lepton, at least two jets with
pT > 30 GeV and ETmiss > 250 GeV. Figure 7.2 shows comparisons of truth- and full-
reconstruction-level distributions for one exemplary signal point. Although the agreement
is in general surprisingly good, some mismodellings of the unsmeared truth samples
become visible. Overall, the unsmeared truth MC samples tend to slightly overestimate
the total number of events after preselection. This is, however, not surprising as no
reconstruction and identification efficiencies are included in the truth MC samples.
Apart from the differences in the total event yields, the truth distributions also exhibit
some differences in shape compared to the reco distributions. For example, as can be seen
in fig. 7.2(h), the simulation of the b-jet multiplicity at unsmeared truth level, exhibits no
agreement at all with the multiplicity from fully reconstructed samples. After applying
smearing on the truth samples, thereby considering b-tagging efficiencies and other
jet reconstruction corrections, a good agreement between truth and full-reconstruction
samples can be achieved (see fig. 7.3(h)).
Similarly, fig. 7.2(b) reveals that the truth samples predict significantly more events with
low-pT leptons than fully reconstructed samples. In fig. 7.4, the lepton pT distribution is
split into the electron and muon components, revealing that electrons contribute more
to the lepton pT mismatch than muons. This is not surprising as electrons have lower
reconstruction and identification efficiencies than muons for relatively low transverse
momenta [58, 56]. After including an approximation of these efficiencies through the use
of the smearing procedure, it can be seen in figs. 7.3(b) and 7.4(b) that the systematic
mismatch for low-pT leptons and especially electrons can be significantly reduced. As
the lepton pT directly influences the meff distribution, the agreement between truth
and full-reconstruction distributions is also improved for meff after smearing the truth
samples.
Additionally, the mT distribution in fig. 7.2(d) reveals that the truth samples exhibit a
slight mismodeling in the shape of mT . Even though the overall normalisation matches
better after smearing, the slight difference in shape persists. However, since the mT
distribution is not used for a shape fit but only a simple lower cut in the SRs, the slight

Figure 7.4: Comparison of the reco-level and truth-level lepton pT distribution split in electron
and muon components. In the left column, unsmeared truth samples are shown, while in the right
column, smeared truth samples are used. The electrons contribute the most to the systematic
mismatch between truth and reco. The application of smearing techniques significantly reduces
the low pT mismatch in the electron distribution. The muon pT distribution does not show a
significant difference after smearing. The error bands and error bars include MC statistical
uncertainty.

mismodelling in the smeared truth sample is considered to have an acceptably low effect
on the final result.


7.2.2     Comparison in the signal regions
For the performance of the shape fit setup, the agreement of the distributions in the SRs
is of central importance, since these are the selections actually used in the fit.
Figure 7.5 shows comparison plots using all the signal points in the signal grid and
comparing the total truth yields with the total reco yields in different signal regions. For
this purpose, the inclusive SRs (adding up all meff bins to a single SR bin, thereby ignoring
the shapes) are used. The left column in fig. 7.5 shows the truth yields before smearing
and the right column after smearing the truth MC samples. The top and middle row
contain scatter plots where each signal point in the signal grid is a single point in the plot.
A drastic improvement can be seen after applying smearing on the truth MC samples.
In general, all points in the scatter plot lie significantly closer to the diagonal, where
  truth
Nevents = Nevents
            reco
                  . This confirms that the overall numbers of events in the SRs predicted
by the smeared truth samples matches the prediction by full-reconstruction samples. A
complete set of scatter plots for the remaining SRs can be found in appendix B.1.
The agreement of the total yields in each SR is further confirmed in the bottom row
in fig. 7.5, showing a combination of all SRs. The ratio between truth and reco yields
for each signal point is determined in each SR and filled in a histogram. Entries from
b-tag SRs are coloured in light green while entries from b-veto SRs have a dark green
colour. The significant overestimation (underestimation) of events in the unsmeared
truth samples in b-veto (b-tag) SRs is again clearly visible. After applying smearing,
the Nevents
       truth   reco
             /Nevents ratio distribution is centred around 1, i.e. Nevents
                                                                    truth     reco
                                                                           ≈ Nevents for a large
portion of the signal points.
As a shape fit in meff is employed in the following, the agreement of the shapes of the
distributions rather than the total yields is of importance for this observable. Figure 7.6
therefore shows a comparison between the distributions in different SRs and for exemplary
signal points. It can be seen that, after smearing the truth samples, the agreement between
the meff distributions is significantly improved, and the small remaining differences in
general lie within the statistical uncertainties.


7.3      Simplified shape fit application
Full-reconstruction signal samples

In order to verify the validity of a simplified shape fit as defined in section 7.1.2, the fit
setup is first applied on the same full-reconstruction MC signal samples that have already
been used in the strong 1-lepton analysis to derive the published analysis results. Thus,

Figure 7.5: Comparison of reco- and truth-level yields in the SRs. All meff -bins are added
up to one single bin per SR. The left column shows the truth yields before smearing and the
right column after smearing the truth MC samples. The top and middle row show scatter
plots of the yields per signal point in specific SRs. The dotted line is the diagonal where
   truth = N reco . The error bars include MC statistical uncertainty. The bottom row combines
Nevents      events
all SRs together, i.e. every signal point in the grid has eight different entries for the eight SRs.
In both representations, a significant improvement is seen in the agreement between truth and
reco yields in the SRs after applying smearing on the truth samples.

Figure 7.7: Comparison of the exclusion contour (solid line) obtained with the simplified
fit (green curve) and the full analysis fit (dark blue curve). Both setups use the same fully
reconstructed MC signal samples and the contours are drawn at 95% CL. The dashed lines
show the ±1σ variations. Expected CLs values are used. Excellent agreement is found between
the simplified and the full setup. Figure (a) shows the signal grid with x = 1/2 and fig. (b)
shows the signal grid with variable x and m(χ̃01 ) = 60 GeV.


the only difference between the resulting expected exclusion limits is the simplified nature
of the shape fit used within this chapter. Figure 7.7 shows a comparison between the
expected exclusion contours obtained by the full analysis fit and by the simplified shape
fit. Excellent agreement is seen throughout both x = 1/2 and the variable-x versions of
the signal grid. Only minor differences are visible in the x = 1/2 grid at very low χ̃01
masses, most probably caused by interpolation artefacts† .
The excellent agreement between the simplified and the full setup validates the procedure
of approximating the statistical model by taking, for each SR bin, the total background
and the total uncertainty and assuming the uncertainties to be fully correlated over all
bins. While the full statistical evaluation in the strong 1-lepton analysis takes multiple
hours per signal point, the simplified shape fit only needs a few seconds. Using this
approximation of the strong 1-lepton analysis, computationally efficient and precise
statements about the sensitivity of the analysis to other supersymmetric models are
possible for the first time.
Figure 7.8 shows a first set of reinterpretation studies of other simplified models within
the analysis, illustrating that sensitivity to a variety of other models, including one with
R-parity violation, are achieved. In figs. 7.8(a) and 7.8(b), the sensitivity to the gluino
two-step model and a pMSSM slice already used in the strong 1-lepton analysis (but
analysed with a SR requiring at least 9 jets [26]) is assessed. Figures 7.8(c) and 7.8(d)
show the sensitivity of the analysis to gluino/squark pair production models including W
and Z/h bosons (as opposed to only W bosons) [95]. Finally, sensitivity is also achieved

              The interpolation of grid edges is problematic because not enough neighbouring interpolation points
              are available on each side.

Figure 7.8: The approximation of the full analysis through the simplified shape fit allows
reinterpretations of other SUSY models within the strong 1-lepton analyis. All shown contours
are expected exclusion limits drawn at 95% CL. Where available, the contours obtained by the
simplified fit (in orange) are compared with expected exclusion contours from analyses targeting
the respective models (in blue). The strong 1-lepton analysis is not only sensitive to various
gluino and squark decay modes, but also a pMSSM slice as well as an R-parity violating model.

Figure 7.9: Comparison of the exclusion contour (solid line) obtained with the simplified fit
(orange curve) and the full analysis fit (dark blue curve). The simplified setup uses smeared truth
samples while the full analysis fit used fully reconstructed MC signal samples. All contours are
drawn at 95% CL and expected CLs values are used. The dashed lines show the ±1σ variations.
Good agreement is found between the simplified and the full setup. Figure (a) shows the signal

towards an R-parity violating simplified model that has already been interpreted in
an analysis searching for supersymmetry in final states with one lepton and high jet
multiplicities [96].


Smeared truth signal samples

As a next step, smeared truth instead of full-reconstruction samples are used with the
simplified fit setup. The results for both gluino grids are shown in fig. 7.9. Still, a good
agreement is found between the simplified fit and the full analysis setup. In the x = 1/2
grid (fig. 7.9(a)), the same interpolation artefacts as before are visible. Additionally, the
exclusion contour in the grid with variable x (fig. 7.9(b)) obtained with the smeared
truth samples and the simplified fit is not as smooth as the full analysis fit result. This
can be explained by the fact that several truth samples for signal points around the
exclusion limit have not been available any more, preventing a smooth interpolation
between the signal points due to the increased interpolation distance. A representation
of the available MC truth samples can be seen in appendix B.3.
This concludes the final step of the validation procedure laid out in fig. 7.1, verifying
that a simplified shape fit using smeared truth samples can successfully and efficiently,
in terms of needed CPU-time, reproduce the results from a full analysis fit by making
use of the fact that an estimation of the background and the systematic uncertainties is
already publicly available. As a final step, the simplified shape fit procedure is applied
on a large number of models sampled from the pMSSM.

7.4       Application on pMSSM signal samples

7.4.1      Model generation
Sampling the 19 dimensional pMSSM parameter space at regular intervals would be
computationally inefficient. Instead, the parameter space is probed by choosing random
values for each parameter. The ranges used to scan the pMSSM parameters are listed
in appendix B.3 and are bound from above by the requirement that they should be in
reach of the LHC. Each unique set of the 19 parameters corresponds to a single model
point in the parameter space and is required to exactly conserve R-parity and have the
lightest neutralino as LSP.
After the sampling of the parameters, the properties of each model are calculated with a
variety of publicly available software packages† . Each sampled signal point is subsequently
required to fulfil a range of experimental and theoretical requirements [28]. Model points
are only accepted if they have consistent electroweak symmetry breaking and a scalar
potential that does not break colour or electric charge. Additionally, the squared-mass
values of all the particles must be positive. Furthermore, models, where SoftSUSY [97] —
a program that calculates the SUSY particle spectrum — reports theoretical pathologies,
are also discarded. Finally, a series of experimental constraints are applied, discussed
in detail in Ref. [28]. They include precision electroweak and flavour constraints, dark
matter constraints as well as collider constraints from LEP and the LHC.
For the set of models fulfilling the requirements, cross-sections are computed and events
are generated. A truth-level analysis including the application of smearing methods is
performed with SimpleAnalysis. Finally, the expected pMSSM yields are compared to
36.1 fb−1 of ATLAS data.
For this work, the result from 61617 pMSSM models have been available and are discussed
in the following.


7.4.2      Observed exclusion power improvement
For each considered pMSSM model, an observed CLs value can be computed by comparing
the pMSSM yields to data through the simplified shape fit. Figure 7.10(a) shows a
histogram of the observed CLs values for all models. As a comparison, the results
achieved with the discovery SRs (that were previously implemented in the scan) are
also included. Models with CLs < 0.5 are considered to be excluded. As expected, the
simplified shape fit significantly increases the number of models that can be excluded.
The scatter plot shown in fig. 7.10(b) confirms that in every case (except one single model),
the simplified shape fit achieves lower CLs values than the discovery SRs. Table 7.2
summarises the number of models excluded by the discovery SRs and the simplified

the simplified shape and the discovery SRs are shown. In fig. (a), the models are binned into
their observed CLs values and the dashed line indicates the CLs < 0.05 threshold needed for

that the shape fit is always better than the discovery SRs.


shape fit, respectively. It shows that, by using the simplified shape fit, four times more
models can be excluded. In total, 10% of the sampled models can be excluded through
the simplified shape fit, but only 2.4% with the discovery SRs when comparing with
ATLAS data.
Figure 7.11 compares the pMSSM model exclusion to the gluino and squark exclusion
contours obtained in the nominal analysis by interpreting data with simplified gluino
and squark pair-production models (shown as orange contour). The pMSSM models are
binned in mg̃ /mq̃ and mχ̃01 and a number indicates how many models fall in each bin.
The colour codes the fraction of pMSSM models in each bin that are excluded through
the strong 1-lepton analysis using the simplified shape fit. Bins coloured in black contain
only excluded models.
In the gluino grid in fig. 7.11(a), although slightly weaker, the exclusion power to pMSSM
models follows more or less the shape of the exclusion limit obtained with the simplified

Figure 7.11: Results of the pMSSM scan in the two-dimensional space spanned by the masses
of the gluino/squark and the LSP in each model. Each bin is labelled with a number indicating
how many sampled models fall into the bin (without any preselection). The colour axis indicates
the percentage of these models excluded by the simplified fit in each bin. Bins where all models
are excluded are painted in black. Bins with no exclusion are left white. The orange contour is
the observed exclusion contour of the strong 1-lepton analysis for the gluino/squark x = 1/2

models. For relatively light LSPs with masses below 300 GeV, and gluino masses up
to 1.6 TeV, more than 90% of the non-compressed pMSSM models can be excluded.
At gluino masses of 2 TeV, the analysis is still able to exclude roughly 40% to 50% of
the sampled models with relatively light LSPs. As the mass of the LSP increases, the
exclusion power decreases. The rate of decrease is slightly faster for pMSSM models than
for the simplified models, resulting in a region at mχ̃01 ≈ 700 GeV and mg̃ ≈ 1.9 TeV where
the discrepancy of the exclusion power between the pMSSM and the simplified models is
slightly larger. The sensitivity to pMSSM models also decreases when approaching the
diagonal. Although the analysis is in general sensitive to extremely compressed simplified
models with mg̃ < 900 GeV, nearly no sensitivity to pMSSM models is observed in that
region and the fraction of excluded models drops to below 1%. The reason for this
discrepancy is further discussed in section 7.4.3.
In the squark grid in fig. 7.11(b), the correspondence between the results from the
simplified models and the exclusion power to the pMSSM models is in general not as
good as in the mg̃ –mχ̃01 plane. Up to mχ̃01 ≈ 100 GeV and mg̃ ≈ 600 GeV, the majority of
the pMSSM models can still be excluded. A decrease of sensitivity towards compressed
models can be observed.
Although the simplified squark one-step model used in the strong 1-lepton analysis
explicitly only considers first and second generation squark production and therefore
the nominal 1-lepton analysis is optimised for first and second generation squarks,
fig. 7.12 shows that decent sensitivity to stop and sbottom quarks is also achieved. Up to

               Figure 7.12: Sensitivity of the strong 1-lepton analysis to third generation squarks.


mt̃1 = 800 GeV (see fig. 7.12(a)) and mb̃1 = 650 GeV (see fig. 7.12(b)), the majority of
the pMSSM models with relatively light LSPs can still be excluded.


7.4.3                  Future prospects
In section 7.4.2, the increase in exclusion power compared to discovery SRs as well as
representations of the sensitivity in different two-dimensional planes have been discussed.
Despite the higher exclusion power of the simplified shape fit compared to the discovery
SRs, the analysis still has a very low sensitivity (CLs > 0.9) to many sampled models.
Instead of looking at models where the analysis is able to achieve at least some sensitivity
or even exclusion, it could potentially be interesting to investigate the models where the
analysis is not able to achieve any sensitivity. Studying these models and explaining why
no sensitivity is achieved, could reveal blind spots or possibilities for future improvement
of the analysis.
Figure 7.13 summarises where the models with low sensitivity are located in the mg̃ –mχ̃01
plane. Only models that have not been excluded by the strong 1-lepton analysis are
used to fill the bins of the histogram. The colour determines how many of these models
also have CLs > 0.9, i.e. very low sensitivity using the simplified shape fit. The specific
value of CLs > 0.9 is chosen to illustrate the distribution of models that have not only
narrowly missed the exclusion, but show no sensitivity at all. Additionally, as can be
seen in fig. 7.10(a), the large majority of models has CLs > 0.9, making it appealing to
investigate their distribution in the mg̃ –mχ̃01 plane. Up to mχ̃01 = 500 GeV and mg̃ = 1 TeV,
i.e. in mass ranges where most models are already excluded, all of the remaining non-
excluded models show very low sensitivity, although cross-sections are in principle still
relatively high. This indicates that these are models where only very few events satisfy
the SR requirements and where it is a priori difficult (or even impossible) to be sensitive

Figure 7.13: Distribution of the pMSSM models where the strong 1-lepton analysis has very
low sensitivity, i.e. CLs > 0.9. Only models with CLs > 0.05 are used to fill the bins. The

the simplified model is shown as reference.


with the 1-lepton analysis and where a slight increase in data is not likely to suddenly
result in exclusion.
This observation can be further investigated by the plots in fig. 7.14. In fig. 7.14(a) the
fraction of low-sensitivity models that have a lepton in less than 0.05% of all events is
shown. Figure 7.14(b) shows the fraction of low-sensitivity models with less than ten total
events with a lepton in the final state. It is visible that the majority of the remaining
low-sensitivity models within the simplified model exclusion contour and especially models
towards more compressed scenarios already fail to produce enough events with a lepton
in the final state. Any other SR cut apart from the lepton requirement is ignored. Even
when lowering the respective thresholds to 0.01% in fig. 7.14(c) and three total events
in fig. 7.14(d) and still not applying any other cuts, the majority of the low-sensitivity
models are still below these requirements. Thus, the lack of sensitivity towards compressed
models can be explained by the fact that most of these models do not produce enough
events with a lepton in the final state. Such models are intrinsically difficult to discover or
exclude with a search that explicitly requires a lepton in the final state. Most importantly,
however, this rules out a lack of coverage of model characteristics or a blind spot of the
analysis as the cause of low sensitivity for these models. For the non-excluded models
well within the simplified model exclusion contour but not covered by the explanation of
not producing enough final states with a lepton, more detailed event-wise information
would be needed in order to investigate the reason for the low-sensitivity.
7.4 Application on pMSSM signal samples                                                            101


In figs. 7.14(e) and 7.14(f),the fraction of non-excluded models with less than 100 events
with at least 6 jets and less than 100 events with ETmiss > 600 GeV, respectively, is shown† .
Although the requirements of at least 6 jets or ETmiss > 600 GeV are relatively tight
when compared to the SR requirements in the strong 1-lepton analysis, only very few
pMSSM models produce less than 100 events. It can therefore be concluded, that the
requirements on the jet multiplicity and ETmiss , contrary to requiring exactly one lepton,
do not significantly restrict the sensitivity to pMSSM models.
Additionally, fig. 7.13 reveals that, from the non-excluded models with relatively high
gluino mass and LSPs with mχ̃01 < 500 GeV, only a small fraction has CLs > 0.9, implying
that there are still quite a lot of models left where the analysis achieves some sensitivity.
Therefore, with 140 fb−1 of data being available by the end of Run-2, the number of
excluded models in that region can be expected to noticeably increase.

    The exact values of the jet multiplicity and ET     requirements are chosen following the relatively
    restricted information available from the pMSSM scan and with the objective to illustrate that even
    tight requirements do not significantly constrain the number of pMSSM models.

Summary

Supersymmetry is a class of theories that extends the Standard Model by introducing a
symmetry between bosons and fermions. It provides an elegant way to resolve some of
the open questions of the Standard Model and, although no supersymmetric particles
have been discovered so far, is one of the most promising extensions to the Standard
Model. However, even the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model has more than 100
free parameters, which is too much to be scanned completely and compared to data.
Therefore, SUSY searches at ATLAS usually employ simplified models, where only a small
set of supersymmetric particles and parameters are studied. All other supersymmetric
particles, not explicitly participating in the considered decay chains, are set to be
kinematically unreachable. In this work, several ideas to search and approaches for SUSY
have been presented. Most of the work presented is based on an analysis searching for
SUSY in events with exactly one isolated lepton, at least two jets and missing transverse
momentum. Previous experiences have shown that this analysis is highly sensitive to
the strong production of gluinos and squarks while remaining model independent to a
large degree. Additionally, a similar electroweak analysis has shown that sensitivity to
electroweak production of SUSY particles can be achieved for a specific simplified model
studying the decays of χ̃±
                         1 χ̃2 → χ̃1 χ̃1 W h with W → ℓν and h → bb̄.
                             0     0 0


The first study presented in this work aims to assess the sensitivity to models featuring
the electroweak production of two charginos with decays to neutralinos and W bosons.
The advantage of this generic model is that it does not include distinctive decays like
h → bb̄, allowing a potential future analysis to remain more model-independent. However,
this also implies that a lower sensitivity is expected due to the lack of discriminating
model characteristics. Although various analysis techniques have been tested and an
integrated luminosity of 140 fb−1 is considered, the sensitivity to this model remains at
relatively low levels. Nonetheless, the model is further pursued as even higher luminosities
will yield better sensitivity and, additionally, a combination with other analyses could
be considered, allowing to make a statement about this model for the first time in the
1-lepton channel.

By exploiting the differing shapes of the mT distribution with multi-bin techniques,
models with chargino masses up to 500 GeV (and potentially more) or lightest neutralino
masses of roughly 40 GeV could be excluded in case no significant excess is seen in data
corresponding to 140 fb−1 . Compared to an analysis searching for supersymmetry in
events with two leptons using the same simplified model and data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 80.5 fb−1 [78], slightly higher chargino masses but lower lightest
neutralino masses can be excluded with this approach. Machine learning techniques
are not found to significantly increase the sensitivity compared to multi-bin likelihood
fits. In general, the achieved significances largely depend on the available Monte Carlo
statistics for estimating the W + jets background, the dominant background in many
interesting kinematic regions. With more statistics available later in Run-2 of the LHC
and/or with data-driven techniques to estimate the W + jets background, the sensitivity
could therefore potentially be further increased.
Instead of using simplified models, the number of parameters of the MSSM can be
reduced by setting a number of constraints. The phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM)
only contains 19 free parameters that can be systematically scanned and compared to
ATLAS data. In a second part of this work, an approximation of the published strong
1-lepton analysis has been presented. With the introduced simplified shape fit procedure,
a computationally efficient and precise statement about the sensitivity of the analysis to
a large number of other supersymmetric models can be made for the first time. Apart
from reinterpretation studies using other simplified models, this approximation allows to
interpret the analysis in a large number of different models belonging to the pMSSM,
resulting in a more appropriate representation of the analysis in a scan of the pMSSM
than has been previously possible.

A.1      N-1 plots for cut-scan results
In the following, a full set of N-1 plots for the cut combinations obtained in the N -
dimensional cut scan presented in section 6.3 is provided. The plots show the cuts on
the different observables as they are obtained by the N -dimensional cut scan, without
any further manual optimisation. The significance is computed with BinomialExpZ by
integrating the number of events in the direction of the cut-arrow and includes a 30%
systematic uncertainty. In view of data-driven methods to estimate especially the W +jets
background, the statistical uncertainty is not included. The N-1 plots are used to further
tune the requirements, i.e. remove cuts that don’t improve the sensitivity noticeably and
tweak some of the cuts to slightly better values. Some of the plots seem to indicate that
a much higher cut value would yield a higher significance. Such cuts, however, are not
chosen by the N -dimensional cut optimisation (and neither by the manual optimisation)
because they fail to fulfil one or more of the statistical requirements set in section 6.3.

Figure A.2: Second set of N-1 plots for the chosen cut combination for the (250, 60) signal
point. These plots form the basis for a manual optimisation step that removes some of the
unnecessary cuts or tweaks suboptimal cuts to better values. In fig. (e), for illustration purposes,
the lower requirement is not applied while the upper cut is scanned.

Figure A.4: Second set of N-1 plots for the chosen cut combination for the (300, 0) signal
point. These plots form the basis for a manual optimisation step that removes some of the
unnecessary cuts or tweaks suboptimal cuts to better values. In fig. (e), for illustration purposes,
the lower requirement is not applied while the upper cut is scanned.

Figure A.6: Second set of N-1 plots for the chosen cut combination for the (400, 0) signal
point. These plots form the basis for a manual optimisation step that removes some of the
unnecessary cuts or tweaks suboptimal cuts to better values. In fig. (e), for illustration purposes,
the lower requirement is not applied while the upper cut is scanned.

Figure A.8: Second set of N-1 plots for the chosen cut combination for the (500, 0) signal
point. These plots form the basis for a manual optimisation step that removes some of the
unnecessary cuts or tweaks suboptimal cuts to better values. In fig. (e), for illustration purposes,
the lower requirement is not applied while the upper cut is scanned.

A.2                Truth- and full-reconstruction-level comparisons
This section summarises the comparisons between the (400,0) signal sample at truth-
level and full-reconstruction-level, after applying smearing on the truth sample with
SimpleAnalysis [89]. The truth sample contains roughly 2 million MC events after
preselection and is used to train the neural net in section 6.6. In general, the agreement
between truth and full reconstruction is found to be sufficiently good for the observables
used within the machine learning algorithm. The mT distribution shows a slight mis-
modeling, even after smearing. Furthermore, the lepton pT distribution reveals that the
truth sample still predicts more low-pT leptons than the fully reconstructed sample, even
though an approximation of detector efficiencies is included through SimpleAnalysis.
Although these minor differences reduce the performance of the neural nets when testing
with events from the fully reconstructed sample, the gain in sensitivity due to the
increased truth statistics is found to prevail.

Figure A.9: First set of ratio plots comparing the various distributions for the (400,0) signal
point at truth and full reconstruction. The truth sample has been smeared. In general, the
agreement is found to be sufficiently good. Most of the differences fall within statistical
uncertainty.

Figure A.10: Second set of ratio plots comparing the various distributions for the (400,0)
signal point at truth and full reconstruction. The truth sample has been smeared. In general,
the agreement is found to be sufficiently good. Most of the differences fall within statistical
uncertainty.

A.3       Available statistics for training MLP
Table A.1 summarises the raw number of events available for training neural nets both
before and after requiring mT > 110 GeV. A preselection of exactly one lepton and at
least two jets is always applied. The available number of fully reconstructed signal events
is extremely low, hence the need for a large statistics truth sample, where more than
600.000 events are still available even after requiring mT > 110 GeV.

Appendix B


B.1      Scatter plots comparing truth and reco yields
         in the SRs
The following figs. B.1 and B.2 show scatter plots comparing the truth and reco yields
in the remaining SRs. Each signal point in the grid corresponds to a single point in the
scatter plot, indicating how well the number of truth events agrees with the number of
reco events, expected through MC. The dashed black line represents the main diagonal
where Nevents
          truth
                = Nevents
                   reco
                          . The left column of each figure shows the results for unsmeared
truth samples, while the right column shows the results for smeared truth samples. In
general, the spread of the points in the scatter plots is much smaller for the smeared
truth samples. Additionally, the mean ratio between truth and reco events is very close
to 1 for smeared truth samples, while it is far away from 1 for unsmeared truth samples.
The missing b-tag and jet efficiencies in the unsmeared truth samples are also visible,
causing an underestimation (overestimation) of events in b-tag (b-veto) SRs.
In general, a significant increase in agreement between truth and reco is observed after
applying smearing techniques on the truth samples.

Figure B.1: First set of reco- and truth-level yields comparisons in the SRs. All meff -bins are
added up to one single bin per SR. The left column shows the truth yields before smearing and
the right column after smearing the truth MC samples. The dashed line is the diagonal where
   truth = N reco . The error bars include MC statistical uncertainty. A significant improvement
Nevents      events
is seen in the agreement between truth and reco yields in the SRs after applying smearing on
the truth samples.

Figure B.2: Second set of reco- and truth-level yields comparisons in the SRs. All meff -bins are
added up to one single bin per SR. The left column shows the truth yields before smearing and
the right column after smearing the truth MC samples. The dashed line is the diagonal where
   truth = N reco . The error bars include MC statistical uncertainty. A significant improvement
Nevents      events
is seen in the agreement between truth and reco yields in the SRs after applying smearing on
the truth samples.

B.2                                     Available truth samples for the gluino one-step
                                        model
Not all signal points in the gluino one-step grid had corresponding truth-level samples
that were still available. Therefore, the truth-level grids are significantly coarser than the
reco-level grids. This results in minor interpolation artefacts, especially when directly
comparing exclusion limits obtained with reco- and truth-level samples, respectively.

B.3        pMSSM parameter scan ranges
Table B.1 summarises the scan ranges used for the 19 pMSSM parameters in order to
sample the model space. The 4 TeV upper bound on most of the mass parameters is used
in order for all the states to be kinematically accessible at the LHC. Since |At | affects
loop corrections to the mass of the Higgs boson, a larger range is permitted for this
parameter in order to increase the fraction of sampled models with a lightes Higgs mass
close to the measured value [28].

     mir ermöglicht aktiv im 1-Lepton Analyseteam an der Suche nach Supersymmetrie
     mitwirken zu können.
   • Dr. Nikolai Hartmann für die unzähligen Diskussionen über den Sinn und Unsinn der
     Datenanalyse mit und ohne ATLAS Software. Vielen Dank für die stets geduldige
     und ausführliche Beantwortung meiner Fragen, sowie das Bereitstellen unzähliger
     Zeilen Code, ohne die vieles schwieriger gewesen wäre.
   • Allen Mitgliedern des Lehrstuhls Schaile für die angenehme und freundliche Arbeits-
     atmosphäre.
   • Allen Freunden, die stets da waren, wenn ich sie gebraucht habe.

I also want to thank the entire 1-lepton analysis team, especially the coordinators Jeanette
Lorenz, Da Xu and Alberto Cervelli. Thank you for the always supportive and enjoyable
work environment. Many thanks also to Valentina Tudorache for patiently answering all
my questions as well as all the entertaining conversations.
En léiwen Merci och dem Yannick Erpelding fir d’Korrekturliesen — och wann en net
alles verstanen huet — an dem Nick Beffort, fir all déi domm Reddit Posts an dei onzähleg
Stonnen zesummen mat enger Spezi an der Hand.
